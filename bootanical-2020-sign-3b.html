<p class="text-center">This rhizomatous perennial succulent is native to the Southeastern United States. It forms large basal rosettes of nearly flat, fleshy, sword-shaped, green leaves that sometimes have red speckles. A tall flower stalk arises from the center displaying fragrant, yellowish-green, tube-shaped flowers.  </p>

<p class="text-center">Native Americans used an infusion of the roots as a wash for snakebites and dropsy (swelling caused by fluid retention). Additionally, they would chew on the roots to treat severe diarrhea and worms. </p>
