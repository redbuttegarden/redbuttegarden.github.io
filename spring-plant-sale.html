<h5 class="text-center">We know many of you look forward to the annual Red Butte Garden spring plant sale fundraiser, and we are grateful that you trust us to help keep your garden stocked with quality annuals, perennials, veggies and herbs, as well as Utah natives. Unfortunately this year we are unable to host our event because of the constraints of social distancing and precautions being taken to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.
	<br />We’re all disappointed that so many of the spring activities and events we look forward to are being cancelled, and we look forward to the time when we can welcome you back to the Garden and share tips and tricks for keeping your own garden growing. Stay healthy and take comfort in the beauty all around you.<h5>
<!--
