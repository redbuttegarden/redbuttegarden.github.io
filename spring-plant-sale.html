	            <br />
	            <ul>
	              <li>Our extensive vegetable selection this year includes over 250 different varieties. This includes 80 different tomato cultivars, 45 different peppers (sweet and hot), 34 squash and pumpkins, and a wide range of greens and cole crops. Many are heirloom selections. Quite a few of the selections have been trialed here at the Garden, so you can try the varieties our staff and volunteers have grown and recommended. We will also have a selection of smaller cultivars that are ideal for small spaces or container gardening.</li><br />
	              <li>Nothing beats the color of flowering annuals for the summer garden! We'll have a wide variety of colors and textures for sun and shade including 175 cultivars. We will also have an exciting assortment of succulents and interior plants. And, don’t forget a hanging basket or mixed planter as a great Mother’s Day gift!</li><br />
	              <li>Stock up your kitchen with our wide selection of culinary and medicinal herbs. Find staples like English Thyme, Rosemary, and Parsley, alongside more unconventional selections such as Bay Laurel and Pineapple Sage. Make your own home remedies with a variety of plants just waiting to be made into teas and tinctures. Whatever your herbal aspirations may be, we'll help you on your way to a flavorful and fresh growing season.</li><br />
	              <li>We will have over 300 different species and cultivars of perennials, including sun and shade loving. There is definitely something for every type of situation, including high elevation gardens and bee-friendly plants. Check out the ‘Specialty Perennial’ section if you’re looking for something truly unique, and allow yourself plenty of time to browse!</li><br />
	              <li>Ornamental grasses add texture and movement to your garden! Often overlooked, grasses serve many functions in a garden in addition to aesthetics. Ornamental Grasses can be used as a focal point or in mass, and come in a variety of colors, textures, sizes, bloom times, and water requirements. Come choose from Bluestem, Feather Reed, Sea Oats, Silver Grass, Muhly, Moor grass and more, including selections ideal for shadier areas, such as Japanese Forest Grass and Sedges. No matter the site conditions or your personal taste we are sure to have an ornamental grass for you!</li><br />
	              <li>From dry shade to swampy sunlight, we have a groundcover for every growing condition in your garden. Use some of our <i>Sedum hakonense</i> on a steep hillside, or some charming <i>Isotoma fluviatilis</i> as a lawn replacement. Aim low-growing for a flowering, fragrant, succulent, or evergreen solution to those tricky garden spaces.</li><br />
	              <li>Our selection of roses includes old-fashioned garden roses, modern shrub roses, miniatures, and climbers. Beautiful blooms of all colors, combined with winter hardiness and disease-resistance, make lovely additions in the home landscape. All of the roses we offer are ‘own-root’ (not grafted) which means although they may be small at first, your favorite rose will not revert back to a root stock variety after a harsh winter.</li><br />
	              <li>We offer a wide variety of flowering and shade trees, unique conifers, colorful shrubs and flowering vines. We also offer a variety of fruit trees, berry bushes, strawberries, and rhubarb. Come with your questions and site information and let us help you select the right plant for your situation.</li><br />
								<li>For a variety of dependable and hard-to-find perennials, grasses, shrubs, and trees, visit this year's inspiring western U.S., Utah native, and water-wise section. We have an expansive selection of <i>Penstemon</i> species as well as exclusive Cottam's Hybrid Oak trees, and stunning cold hardy succulents. Native plants support native pollinators and wildlife, creating a thriving habitat in your yard.</li><br />
