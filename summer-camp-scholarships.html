<p class="text-center">Please note that because funds are limited and demand for camp is high, qualifying for a scholarship does not guarantee a scholarship award or guarantee a spot in the summer camp of your choice.</p>

<p class="text-center">Parents or guardians are responsible to provide transportation for their child to and from camp each day.</p>

<h5 class="text-center red"><sup>*</sup> If awarded a scholarship, a $5 non-refundable deposit per child is due at the time of registration in order to secure your camper’s spot in camp.</h5>
