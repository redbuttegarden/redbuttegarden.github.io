<p class="text-center">Pot Marigold is a commonly planted annual with bright yellow to deep orange flowers. The green leaves are aromatic and lance to oblong-shaped.</p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">In France, garlands of Pot Marigold flowers were hung from door handles to protect those inside from evil energies and infectious diseases, as well as strewn under beds to protect people while sleeping. The French also believed that if you stared at <i>Calendula</i> blooms, one’s eyesight would improve. </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">The name <i>Calendula</i> comes from the latin word <i>kalendae</i>, meaning “first” because it tends to bloom either the at first of the summer months or during the new moon. Because of its consistency to bloom during a new moon, led it to becoming a symbol of the Roman calendar, noting the beginning of each lunar phase.  </p>

<p class="text-center">Pot Marigold has a rich history of medicinal use. It is used both externally and internally. The most familiar use being topically for soreness, rashes, burns, abrasions, swellings, eczema, acne, surgical wounds, scrapes, chicken pox, and the list go on. When used medicinally, <i>Calendula</i> pairs well with the BOOtanically Wicked plant Heartleaf Arnica for muscle pain and topical injuries. Unlike <i>Arnica</i>, though, Pot Marigold can be used on open wounds. </p>
