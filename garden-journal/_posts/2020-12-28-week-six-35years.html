<h5>Last week was the sixth and final week of the Garden's 35 Years of Growing, 35 Days of Giving Annual Appeal Campaign that began on November 27. We finished up our themed gardens stories featuriung the Natural Area, Wildflower Meadow, and Water Conservation Garden. Then, a few words about how the Garden continues to grow in spite of COVID-19 difficulties. Longtime Garden volunteer and donor, JoLynda Stillman, shares her Red Butte Garden experience.

    <h5 class="text-center">Red Butte Garden Natural Area</h5>
    <p class="text-center">Red Butte Garden has approximately 70 acres of Natural Area with 3.75 miles of trails in the foothills which makes us unique when compared to other botanical gardens.
                       It includes diverse plant and wildlife habitatsâ€” riparian, grass-forb, and Oak-Maple communities.</p>

      <h5 class="text-center">Red Butte Garden Wildflower Meadow</h5>
      <p class="text-center">Words by Neal Dombrowski, Red Butte Garden Horticulturist</p>
         <p class="text-center">The visual transformation of the Wildflower Meadow throughout the year begins with early bulbs shooting beyond the greening grasses and perennial foliage in early spring. Meadow Camas <i>(Camassia quamash)</i>, Wild Hyacinth <i>(Triteleia grandiflora)</i>, Mariposa Lily <i>(Calochortus sp.)</i>, and Pink Nodding Onion <i>(Allium cernuum)</i> are some of the bulbs that can be seen blooming in the Meadow. Later in the spring and summer, Prairie Junegrass <i>(Koeleria macrantha)</i>, Giant Sacaton <i>(Sporobolus wrightii)</i>, Little Bluestem <i>(Schizachyrium scoparium)</i>, and Prairie Dropseed <i>(Sporobolus heterolepis)</i> start to mound in shades of green as Utah Sweetvetch <i>(Hedysarum boreale)</i>, Blue Flax <i>(Linum perenne)</i>, Mexican Hat <i>(Ratibida columnifera)</i>, and Bee Balm <i>(Monarda fistulosa)</i> are open for business to pollinators.</p>

      <p class="text-center">The three-acre Water Conservation Garden, opened in 2017, is our newest and largest cultivated garden. It contains a variety of terraced, themed gardens which demonstrate various low-water gardening techniques and planting schemes. Situated in the foothills, the view of the valley and mountains can be breathtaking.

      <h5 class="text-center">Bouncing Back During the COVID-19 Crisis </h5>
      <p class="text-center">When the Garden closed to the public on March 13, most adminstrative staff began working remotley from home and have been ever since. The Garden's budget, staff hours, and wage cuts became necessary last spring because of the cancellation of the 2020 Outdoor Concert Series, Annual Spring Plant Sale, summer camps, hands-on classes, Garden After Dark, and many weddings.
        During this time, Red Butte Garden began offering more online classes, at-home Boredom Buster activities, created a new event called BOOtanical, and developed new ways to reach teachers and students. The Visitor Center was retrofitted to adhere to social distancing policies and reopened on June 29. Our rock star Horticuture team has worked diligently keeping the Garden beautiful in spite of limited hours and less volunteers.
