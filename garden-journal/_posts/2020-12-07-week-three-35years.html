    <p class="text-center">From its beginning in the 1980s as a series of five or six alfresco summer concerts in the Garden on Sunday evenings, to the current 3,000-capacity amphitheatre, Red Butte Garden is the place to experience some of the best summer concerts in Utah. Check out our <a href="https://www.redbuttegarden.org/keeping-the-music-alive/">Keeping the Music Alive</a> live-stream concert options.</p>

      <h5 class="text-center">The Oak Tunnel in the Natural Area</h5>
      <p class="text-center">From 1848 to the 1940s Red Butte Canyon was the site of a sandstone quarry. Many early Salt Lake City homes, such as the famous McCune Mansion, and buildings were built using Red Butte sandstone (Nugget sandstone).
               At that time the Oak Tunnel path was a wooden railway used to carry sandstone out of the quarry to the mouth of the canyon. When the tracks were removed, the old railway line remained raised, forcing the Gambel oaks to grow up and around, forming a tunnel. Now it is a peaceful path to walk and an exciting place for kids to explore.</p>

      <p class="text-center">Our School Programs team serves 25,000 students across the state each school year. We offer Botany Bins, Grow Lab, and Field Classes. Our goal is to deliver highly effective environmental and horticultural education programs that have a meaningful and measurable impact on teachers and students of varying grade levels and backgrounds. All three programs are offered at no cost to public and charter schools.

      <h5 class="text-center">Red Butte Garden Children's Programs</h5>
        <p class="text-center">Discover. Learn. Grow. at Red Butte Garden Summer Camp. Kids in kindergarten through sixth grade spend a week or two in the Garden learning hands-on about botany, animals, art, science, and more.
                  Garden Advetures and Lil' Buds are short classes that a parent and a child can attend together to learn about the Garden and create nature-inspired crafts. All of the 2020 children's summer programs were cancelled last spring. We hope to be able to offer them in the near future. </p>
