    <p>This spring visit Red Butte Garden to see the growing display of 460,000 blooming bulbs! In the fall of 2017, staff and volunteers planted 32,600 more bulbs, including many in the Adaptive Beauty terrace of the new Water Conservation Garden. </p>

    <p>The bulbs usually begin to bloom in March with ground-covering mini-Iris in various shades of blues, purples, and yellows. Then in April, fresh, show-stopping daffodils herald the arrival of spring. Visit the Garden April 14 through April 28 for the best blooms. The Garden has over 239,018 daffodils and 228,413 other bulbs such as Allium, Anemone, Cyclamen, Galanthus, Hyacinth, and more. Flowering bulbs are not the only showy spring display- trees and shrubs also begin to blossom       throughout the Garden - serviceberry, crabapple, magnolia, flowering cherry, pears, and lilacs. </p>

    <p>Since 2013, Red Butte Garden has been recognized as an official Daffodil Display Garden by the American Daffodil Society. Our display represents all 13 recognized daffodil divisions, which are based on floral parts and species derivation.
    Divisions include: Trumpet, Large-Cupped, Small-Cupped, Double, Triandrus, Cyclamineus, Jonquilla, Tazetta, Poeticus, Bulbocodium, Split-Cupped, Miniatures, Miscellaneous Species and Wild Forms. Our display also includes many recipients of the Wister Awards, which recognizes outstanding American hybridizers and daffodil selections </p>
