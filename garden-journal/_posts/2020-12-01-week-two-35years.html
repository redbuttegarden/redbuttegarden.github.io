    <p class="text-center">From its beginning in the 1980s as a series of five or six alfresco summer concerts in the Garden on Sunday evenings, to the current 3,000-capacity amphitheatre, Red Butte Garden is the place to experience some of the best summer concerts in Utah.

      <h5 class="text-center">The Oak Tunnel in the Natural Area</h5>
      <p class="text-center">From 1848 to the 1940s Red Butte Canyon was the site of a sandstone quarry. Many early Salt Lake City homes, such as the famous McCune Mansion, and buildings were built using Red Butte sandstone (Nugget sandstone).
               At that time the Oak Tunnel path was a wooden railway used to carry sandstone out of the quarry to the mouth of the canyon. When the tracks were removed, the path remained raised, forcing the Gambel oaks to grow up and around, forming a tunnel. Now it is a peaceful path to walk and an exciting place for kids to explore.</p>

        <p class="text-center">Discover. Learn. Grow. at Red Butte Garden Summer Camp. Kids in kindergarten through sixth grade spend a week or two in the Garden learning hands-on about botany, animals, art, science, and more.
                  Garden Advetures and Lil' Buds are short classes that a parent and a child can attend together to learn about the Garden and create nature-inspired crafts.</p>
