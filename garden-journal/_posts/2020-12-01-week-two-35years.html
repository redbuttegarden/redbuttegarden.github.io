    <h5 class="text-center">Red Butte Garden Outdoor Concert Series</h5>
    <p>From its beginning in the 1980s as a series of five or six alfresco summer concerts in the Garden on Sunday evenings, to the current 3,000-capacity amphitheatre, Red Butte Garden is the place to experience some of the best summer concerts in Utah.</p>

      <h5 class="text-center">The Oak Tunnel in the Natural Area</h5>
      <p>Over 100 years ago, Red Butte Canyon was the site of a sandstone quarry. Many early homes and buildings in Salt Lake City were built using this sandstone.</p>
      <p>At that time the path of the Oak Tunnel was a railway to carry sandstone out of the quarry and to the mouth of the canyon. When the tracks were removed, the path remained raised, forcing the gambel oaks to grow up and around, forming a tunnel.</p>
