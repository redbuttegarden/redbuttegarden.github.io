    <h4 class="green">To the Friends of Red Butte Garden, </h4>

    The health and well-being of the Red Butte Garden community—our staff, students, volunteers, guests, and members—is our highest priority. That is why, in consideration of the protective measures recommended by our governor and the University of Utah to combat the coronavirus, <b>we are closing the Garden at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, March 13 and will remain closed until further notice.</b>
    We will continue to apply the cleaning and social distancing protocols being advocated by the University of Utah. </p>

    <p>Look for up-to-date communications on the <a href="https://dps.utah.edu/coronavirus/">University of Utah Dept. of Public Safety webpage.</a> </p>

    <p>Red Butte Garden staff will continue operations to ensure the upkeep of the Garden and facilities so that we can be ready to receive guests as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>We will provide more information as the situation progresses. See updates below. Stay tuned and stay healthy.</p>
