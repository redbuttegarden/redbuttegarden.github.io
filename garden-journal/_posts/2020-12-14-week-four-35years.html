<h5>This week we told stories about the Garden's Narcissus (daffodil) and Rose Collections and shed a little light on all the important field work and plant research our Conservation Department does. Not to mention the behind the scenes and on the scene work our Youth and Family Programs team does to create all the the Garden's family-friendly events.
   We gave a shout out to our Garden members and highlighted our unique, botanically-inspired gift shop. </h5>

      <h5 class="text-center">Red Butte Garden Rose Collection</h5>
         <p class="text-center">Roses have been cultivated for over 2000 years. In the wild, roses have only five petals, but over centuries, selections with more petals have been  cultivated, creating the rose varieties we're familiar with today.
           Roses are located throughout the Garden with the greatest diversity showcased in the Rose Garden. Catch the peak bloom of the Garden's roses in June.

      <h5 class="text-center">Red Butte Garden Plant Conservation</h5>
      <p class="text-center">Red Butte Garden Conservation staff and volunteers spend a great amount of time out in the field monitoring endangerd native plants and collecting seeds. Our seed bank serves as an “ark” for hundreds of thousands of living seeds of 22 threatened and endangered species as a hedge against extinction in the wild and as a research source.
              We conserve Utah’s stunning diversity of plant life by finding new ways of conserving rare plant species, developing useful species, and managing natural landscapes.

      <h5 class="text-center">Red Butte Garden Gypsum Wasterock Study</h5>
      <p class="text-center">For the last ten years the RBG Conservation team has worked with Western Mining and Minerals to develop the use of gypsum-containing waste rock as a top-dressing for highly disturbed habitat.
               These techniques worked to help reestablish a native plant species while inhibiting the growth of non-native weeds such as red brome (Bromus rubens) within the restored mine site areas.

      <h5 class="text-center">Red Butte Garden Gift Shop History</h5>
       <p class="text-center">The Red Butte Garden Gift Shop first opened with the Visitor Center in 1994. It was much smaller then, only 400 sq. ft. The shop was expanded to 1200 sq. ft. in 2010 and included new jewelry cases.
                   For the last 10 years, the cases have enabled us to display fine jewelry, including pieces from the Michael Michaud Jewelry Collection, a world renowned designer of botanical jewelry. <a href="https://www.redbuttegarden.org/gift-shop/">Learn More.</a> </p>
