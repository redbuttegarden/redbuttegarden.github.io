    <h4 class="green">March 17, 2020 - To the Friends of Red Butte Garden, </h4>

    <p>We know parents and caregivers devote many hours researching and scheduling summer break activities for their children, and we are grateful for those families who trust Red Butte Garden to provide safe, educational, and fun summer camp programming. We look forward to seeing our campers return each yearâ€”there is nothing more uplifting than the sound of children in the Garden.</p>

  	<p>During this uncertain time, it is important for us to acknowledge that we may soon be in a position where we are unable to fulfill our summer camp and Lil' Buds class schedules. If and when we need to exercise this option, we will issue full refunds to those who have paid for summer camps. Families may also decide to cancel now and receive a full refund.</p>

  	<p>We will regularly update our website and provide new details to our summer camp patrons as they become available.</p>
