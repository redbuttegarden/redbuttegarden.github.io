			<h3 class="text-center green">About the Grow Lab Program</h3>
			<p class="text-center">Students and teachers love this inquiry based, hands-on science program. Created in 2001, the Grow Lab Program is designed around the Wisconsin Fast Plant, which matures from seed to seed in 40 days. Each student plants their own plant and learns about plant parts, germination, flowering, pollination, fruit development, and seed dispersal. The Grow Lab Program is provided at NO COST to Utah’s 1st grade teachers in public and charter schools. The program includes a teacher workshop, a grow lab light frame kit, planting materials and Wisconsin Fast Plant seeds, an eight lesson curriculum, materials for hands-on activities, a classroom plant poster, a virtual classroom visit, and ongoing support. Materials, supplies, and staff time are valued at over $500.</p>

			<h3 class="text-center red">Fall 2020 Grow Lab Changes:</h3>
			<p class="text-center red">As the world continues to navigate the COVID-19 Pandemic, Red Butte Garden is offering the following alternatives to the traditional Grow Lab program to help keep our staff, volunteers, students, and educators safe. Please note, these changes are for Fall 2020 only. The Garden will reassess the Grow Lab program this November for Spring 2021 using the latest Federal, State, City, and University guidelines. </p>

				<h5>Lowest Risk: </h5>
				<ul>
				<li>Teachers assign and administer pre-recorded videos, student worksheets etc. to all students virtually. Students in classrooms may watch the experiment with no hands-on components.</li>
			  </ul>
				<h5>Some Risk: </h5>
				<ul>
	      <li>Teachers plant 6-7 Brassica rapa plants in your classroom and allow students to interact with plants as they grow (if students attend in-person). Teachers can administer some hands-on, single-use/disposable activities. </li>
	      <li>Teachers should follow all district guidelines for sharing materials and passing demonstration plants around/viewing in a shared location. </li>
