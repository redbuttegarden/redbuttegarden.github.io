			<h3 class="text-center green">About the Grow Lab Program</h3>
			<p class="text-center">Students and teachers love this inquiry based, hands-on science program. Created in 2001, the Grow Lab Program is designed around the Wisconsin Fast Plant, which matures from seed to seed in 40 days. Each student plants their own plant and learns about plant parts, germination, flowering, pollination, fruit development, and seed dispersal. The Grow Lab Program is provided at NO COST to Utah’s 1st grade teachers in public and charter schools. The program includes a teacher workshop, a grow lab light frame kit, planting materials and Wisconsin Fast Plant seeds, an eight lesson curriculum, materials for hands-on activities, a classroom plant poster, a virtual classroom visit, and ongoing support. Materials, supplies, and staff time are valued at over $500.</p>

			<p class="text-center red">Grow Lab is continuing this school year with a few virtual adaptations.</p>
			<p class="text-center">As the world continues to navigate the COVID-19 Pandemic, Red Butte Garden is offering alternatives of the traditional Grow Lab program to help keep our staff, volunteers, students, and educators safe. </p>
      <p class="text-center red">Click on the tabs below for ways you can conduct Grow Lab with your current teaching scenario whether it is at home learning, hybrid classrooms, or all in-person teaching.</p>
		  <p class="text-center">Please note, these changes are currently for the 2020-2021 school year. The Garden will reassess the Grow Lab program monthly using the latest Federal, State, City, and University guidelines.</p>

				<br />
        <h5 class="text-center">If you’re a returning Grow Lab classroom and have at home students or a hybrid teaching scenario with some distance learners and some in-person students, you can still conduct the Grow Lab program! Check out the options below and assess which is best for your school and district. Then, click the link to request virtual or pre-recorded materials.</h5>
				<h5>Lowest Risk: </h5>
				<ul>
				<li>Teachers assign and administer pre-recorded videos, student worksheets etc. to all students virtually. Students in classrooms may watch the experiment with no hands-on components.</li>
			  </ul>
				<h5>Some Risk: </h5>
				<ul>
	      <li>Teachers plant 6-7 Brassica rapa plants in your classroom and allow students to interact with plants as they grow (if students attend in-person). Teachers can administer some hands-on, single-use/disposable activities. </li>
	      <li>Teachers should follow all district guidelines for sharing materials and passing demonstration plants around/viewing in a shared location. </li>

				<h5>Lowest Risk: </h5>
	      <ul>
				<li>Teachers assign and administer pre-recorded videos, student worksheets etc. to all students in classroom. Students in classrooms may watch experiment with no hands-on components, or watch teacher completing hands on components.</li>

	      <li>Teachers plant 6-7 Brassica rapa demonstration plants in your classroom and allow students to interact with plants as they grow. Teachers can administer some hands-on, single-use/disposable activities. </li>
	      <li>Teachers should follow all district guidelines for sharing materials and passing demonstration plants around/viewing in a shared location. </li>
			  </ul>

	      <h5>Highest Risk:</h5>
				<ul>
	      <li>Teachers allow students to plant their own individual plants in classroom.</li>
	      <li>Planting can be facilitated by Garden educators via Zoom, or by a previously trained teacher.</li>
	      <li>Teachers perform all unit activities and lesson plans with adjustment to each lesson in accordance with district return-to-school guidelines.</li>
			</ul>

				<h5 class="text-center green">Planting materials (seeds, soil, etc.) will be available for pick up at Red Butte Garden OR will be available for drop off at your school/district (based on availability and location). </h5>
