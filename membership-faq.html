						<li>
							Make sure you have an active online account connected to your membership by signing in or registering <a href="https://55218.blackbaudhosting.com/55218/page.aspx?pid=201">here.</a>

						<li>

						</li> 
							<ul>
								<li>
									You must be logged in to see the opportunity to purchase and receive your free member tickets.
								</li>
								<li>
									Your discount will be reflected at the very end of the process, so don't fret early on when it looks like a regular transaction.
								</li>
								<li>
									When you come to the garden, you can use a copy of your tickets on your phone, a printed copy, or just give Visitor Services staff your name.
