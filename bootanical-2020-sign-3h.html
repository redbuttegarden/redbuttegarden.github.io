<p class="text-center">Despite what the common name suggests, Prickly Ash is not an actual Ash, it is in the same family as lemons and limes. Prickly Ash leaves resemble that of Ash but with prickles, which is where it got its common name. It is an aromatic deciduous shrub that forms thickets. Inconspicuous, greenish-yellow flowers bloom in spring before the leaves appear.  </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">The fruit from Prickly Ash produce a numbing effect when rubbed on the skin or chewed on. Another common name for the plant is Toothache Tree because Native Americans chewed the bark and fruits for relief from toothache pain. The roots and bark have further medicinal use for fever, coughs, and external wounds.  </p>
