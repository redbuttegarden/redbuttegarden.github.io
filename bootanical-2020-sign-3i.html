<p class="text-center">This Utah Native Cholla is a low mat forming or upright succulent shrub. It can be highly variable in appearance. It produces beautiful yellow flowers that contrast the thick, white, long spines.  </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">One can tell this plant is wicked just by looking at it. Long white spines are very sharp. You donâ€™t want to accidentally step or fall on this plant or you will be feeling it for some time. Some people plant this in places they do not want humans or animals. </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">Native Americans use this cactus ceremonially as a prayer stick. They also use the roots medicinally, as a salve for skin ailments. With the spines rubbed off, the fruit is eaten raw, or cooked in stew. </p>
