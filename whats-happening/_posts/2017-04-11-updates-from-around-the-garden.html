<p>As the snow melts and the Garden begins to bloom, life awakens at Red Butte Garden. Our collections of conifers, roses, daffodils, and more are alive with the spirit of spring. The Garden never looked so good!</p>

<p>As the Garden changes colors and forms, so has our website. At Red Butte we worked hard to create a refreshed and streamlined way for you to access our events and information. The new site brings a modern design, enhanced functionality, and a mobile optimized experience for visitors on the go.</p>
