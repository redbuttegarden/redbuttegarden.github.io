<div class="text-center">Bark is the outer layer of trees and shrubs. It provides protection against the outdoor elements, insulates against extreme temperatures, prevents water loss, and wards off insects. Bark comes in many different colors and textures, of which can be seen here at Red Butte Garden. Come see for yourself.</div>

  <p>As the old bark sheds, it creates a unique contrast of texture and colors.</p>

  <p>Common Snow Drop &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Galanthus nivalis</i></p>
  <p>As the snow is melting, the snow drops are blooming!</p>

<div class="text-center">With the weather warming, now is a good time to visit the Garden and learn to identify trees by their bark. You will also be able to catch a first glimpse of the early bloomers and those getting ready to bloom.</div>
