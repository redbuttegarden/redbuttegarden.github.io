<p class="text-center"> This week I'd like to highlight the Sprout House Roof. I am stunned at all the beauty happening. This is an area that is easy to overlook, so I want to give it the full spotlight, as well as a shout out to the Natural Area crew - Neal and Jaime - who manage this area. Bravo! </p>

<h5 class="text-center">Dorr's Sage &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Salvia dorrii </i></h5>
<p class="text-center">This is the native species of the cultivar above. With flowers so nice, it gets featured twice.</p>

<h5 class="text-center">Uinta Basin Hookless Cactus &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sclerocactus wetlandicus</i></h5>
<p class="text-center">This is a Utah native, threatened species, endemic to the Uinta Basin. Its habitat is threatened by oil and gas production and development.</p>

<h5 class="text-center">Rocky Mountain Penstemon &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Penstemon strictus</i></h5>
<p class="text-center">Audible Gasp! Orange and purple are my new favorite color combination. The orange contrast in the background is provided by Globemallow.</p>

<h5 class="text-center">Southern Utah</h5>
<p class="text-center">Just kidding, just kidding, this is the Sprout House Roof, but doesn't it have Southern Utah vibes?</p>
<br/>

<img src="/images/blogs/whats-blooming-blog/2020-05-27/yucca-nana-hms20.jpg" alt="Dwarf Yucca" title="Dwarf Yucca" class="img-center responsive" style="max-width: 600px;" />
<h5 class="text-center">Dwarf Yucca &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Yucca nana</i></h5>
<p class="text-center">These unique flowers accomodate their only pollinator, the Yucca Moth. Yucca and Yucca Moths have developed a symbiotic relationship with each other, the plant depends on the moth for pollination, and the moth depends on the yucca plant as a host for its larvae stage. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal.</p>
<br/>


<p class="text-center">We hope everyone is happy and healthy, and able to enjoy the beauty just outside your doorstep.</p>
