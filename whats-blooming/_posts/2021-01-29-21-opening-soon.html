<p class="text-center">Pricklypear displays beautiful coloring in the winter.</p>

<h5 class="text-center">New Mexico Agave &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Agave parryi</i> var.<i> neomexicana</i></h5>
<p class="text-center">The contrast of agave against the snow is stunning.</p>

<br/>
<p class="text-center">Winter creates a wonderful time to learn how to identify conifers. Looking at the leaves and their arrangement will give you a lot of information.</p>

<h5 class="text-center">Bristlecone Pine &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Pinus aristata</i></h5>
<p class="text-center"><i>Pinus</i> species can be distinguished by their needles which are clumped together in groups, known botanically as fascicles. The number of needles in each fascicle will help you determine which species you are looking at. This Utah native species has 5 needles per fascicle.</p>

<h5 class="text-center">Colorado Blue Spruce &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Picea pungens</i></h5>
<p class="text-center">Spruce needles do not grow in groups, they are single needle. A way to distinguish spruces, remember that spruce starts with the letter 'S'. Spruce leaves are 'Spiky'. The needles have a pointed tip and are sharp to the touch. Spruce leaves are 'Square' in cross section. You will be able to roll the needle between your fingers. Spruce bark is 'Scaly'. With age, spruce trees bark becomes rough and scaly. </p>

<h5 class="text-center">White Fir &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Abies concolor</i></h5>
<p class="text-center">Firs are also single needle. Their needles are flat in cross section. You will not easily be able to roll the needle between your fingers. The needles are softer to the touch than spruce. A way to remember this is the saying, firs are furry.  </p>

<p class="text-center">We look forward to seeing you in February!</p>
