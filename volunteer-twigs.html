<h3 class="green">Internship and Volunteer Summary</h3>

<p>TWIG volunteers and interns can either work alongside adult instructors to help lead garden-based activities for children ages 5-12 in our Summer Camp program, or join one of our Horticulture crews for hands-on garden experience. <!-- or by joining our Outdoor Concet Series crew.--></p>
<p>TWIGs spend most of their time outdoors, behind-the-scenes, with Red Butte Garden staff, Summer Camp kids, other volunteers, and Garden guests. Additionally, TWIGs learn how to be environmental educators as they gain experience planning and teaching youth programs on a variety of subjects including but not limited to: botany, horticulture, environmentalism, and more. TWIGs will also gain valuable job skills including teamwork, communication, public speaking, and responsibility.</p>
