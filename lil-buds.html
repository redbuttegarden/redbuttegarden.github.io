<h4 class="green">Red Butte Garden 2020 Summer Youth Programs Cancellation and Refunds </h4>
<p>We know parents and caregivers devote many hours researching and scheduling summer break activities for their children, and we are grateful for those families who trust Red Butte Garden to provide safe, educational, and fun summer camp programming. We look forward to seeing our campers return each year—there is nothing more uplifting than the sound of children in the Garden.</p>
<p>At Red Butte Garden, we are doing our part to protect those who make the Garden the extraordinary place it is, including our guests, members, volunteers, staff, and supporters like you. We are actively following the guidance of federal, state, county, and university officials to ensure our decisions reflect our dedication to helping slow the spread of COVID-19. It is because of this that we regretfully cancel all in-person youth programs and classes at the Garden through August 31, 2020. </p>
<p><b>This cancellation includes: Garden Adventures, Lil’ Buds Classes, and Summer Camps</b> </p>
<p>We recognize this is disheartening news and would like to express our shared disappointment in the current situation. Not only do we love spending the summer with you and your children, but canceling our programs also profoundly impacts our ability to fund future programs, Garden maintenance, and staff time.</p>
<p>The Garden’s customer service team will work with you to apply your registration fees in the manner of your choosing. </p>
<p><b>Your options include:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>A credit towards a membership purchase or renewal (including gift memberships)</li>
		<li>The donation of all or a portion of your expenditure as a charitable gift</li>
		<li>A full refund</li>
	</ul>

<p>Please be advised, the Garden will handle a significant number of inquiries during this time. Calls to the Garden may experience considerable delays. </p>

<p>To expedite this process, please complete our <a href="https://redbuttegarden.formstack.com/forms/covid19_class_refund"> COVID-19 Class Refund Form </a> </p>
<p>You will receive an email from our customer service team once we have processed your request. If we do not hear from you, we will contact you directly.</p>
