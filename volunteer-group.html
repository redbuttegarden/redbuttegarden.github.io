		<h4><div class="green">Group Volunteering</div></h4>

			<p5>Are you looking for an opportunity for office, church, scout troops, school, or other organized service groups to volunteer on a one-time basis? Red Butte Garden provides opportunities to work in the Garden helping with garden plantings, mulching, weeding, and other projects that could take weeks to accomplish without large volunteer groups.</p5>
			<p5>Working in the Garden includes physical labor (hiking, kneeling, bending, lifting, etc.) and working in a variety of weather conditions. Red Butte Garden can accommodate groups of up to 75 volunteers.</p5>
			<h5><div class="green">Available: March – November depending on the weather. Please contact us two-three weeks in advance of your preferred service date.</div></h5>

			<p5>We are not accepting group volunteer applications at this time - please check back in the early spring of 2021. Thank you. </h5>
			<!--<h5>Fill out the <a href="https://redbuttegarden.formstack.com/forms/groupvolunteerrequest">GROUP VOLUNTEER APPLICATION</a>-->

	<!--	<h4><div class="green">Eagle Scout Projects</div></h4>

			<h5><div class="green">Thank you for your interest in this program! We are not currently accepting Eagle Scout Project applications.</div></h5>
			<p5>Eagle Scouts have provided Red Butte Garden with dozens of valuable projects over the years and we are truly grateful for their contributions. Scouts interested in completing their Eagle project at Red Butte Garden need to contact the Volunteer Coordinator who will provide the Eagle Scout Policy, a list of possible projects, and the Eagle Scout Application for the scout to complete. The leadership component of the Eagle Scout Program is important to us and we look forward to working directly with dedicated and enthusiastic Scouts.</p5>
