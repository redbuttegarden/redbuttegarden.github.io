				<p class="text-center"><strong>Before the concert series on sale date, we suggest that you do a couple things to prepare:</strong><br />
				1. Make sure your Garden-Flex level or above membership is current - and that you know the correct email address that is assigned to your Garden membership.</p>

				<p class="text-center">2. Set up your personal Ticketfly account - The Red Butte Garden Outdoor Concert Series uses an external ticketing system called Ticketfly.<br />

				<p class="text-center">Be aware that third-party ticket vendors and scalpers use the 'Red Butte Garden' name in some way to sell overpriced or invalid tickets. We recommend that you only purchase authentic Red Butte Garden Outdoor Concert Series tickets online at: <a href="https://redbuttegarden.ticketfly.com/">https://redbuttegarden.ticketfly.com</a> or <a href="https://ticketfly.com">ticketfly.com</a></p>
				<p class="text-center">You can also purchase tickets in-person at the Red Butte Garden Visitor Center, or by calling Ticketfly at: <strong>877-987-6487</strong></p>
