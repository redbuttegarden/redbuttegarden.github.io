<p class="text-center">This climbing perennial vine can grow to 30 feet or more. The broad green leaves may be 3-7 lobed or not lobed at all. The plant is dioecious which means each plant is either a male or female. The male flowers are inconspicuous and the female flowers are green and mature into a papery cone-shaped cluster.   </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">This plant is most known for its use in beer as it adds flavor as well as prolongs shelf life. However, it is also used in medicine as a mild sedative and is becoming more popular as scientists learn more about its medicinal properties. One of the first recorded accounts of Hopsâ€™ medicinal use is that of George III, King of the United Kingdom (1738-1820) who was treated by laying him on a bed of pillows filled with Hops to calm him. Native Americans have used Common Hops as a sleep aid for insomnia, nervousness, and a pain killer. </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">The first documented use of Hops in beer is in the 9th century, which was about 9,000 years after brewing beer began. The addition of Hops to beer began as a flavoring and later found it was preventing the beer from spoiling and going sour. </p>
