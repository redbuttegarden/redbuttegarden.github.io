<p>Did you know ladybugs are often called a “gardener’s best friend?” They earned this title because ladybugs eat insects that damage plants like aphids, mites, and white flies. One ladybug can eat over 5,000 insects in its lifetime.
  Grab a square of paper and download the instructions to create one or many unique ladybugs you can use to decorate your home and remember this important insect.</p>
<p>Share your designs with us at #RedButteGarden.

<p>Origami is the art of paper folding and is thought to help develop better eye-hand coordination and concentration skills.</p>
