<p class="text-center">Roses are an amazingly versatile and valuable landscape plant great perfect for the Utah garden. Known for their beautiful flowers, fragrance, and long season of bloom, roses are great additions to perennial gardens, shrub borders, and more. Learn the difference between shrub roses, hybrid Tea's, climbers, floribundas, and grandiflora so you can select the roses right for your garden. Class is combination of classroom instruction and garden walks and will cover rose selection, planting, deadheading, water, fertilizer, and pest control. Spring pruning is covered in a separate class so will only briefly be covered. Dress appropriately for being outdoors. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
