<p class="text-center">They get enough water. They get enough light. So why aren't your plants as healthy or as big as you think they should be? It could be the soil. Did you know approximately 90% of plant problems are soil related? Soil is where it all begins and this course is where you begin learning about it. We will cover the physical, biological, and chemical properties of soils as well as basic plant nutrition and fertilization that will help you achieve an optimum planting and growing environment. Discussion will include soil, soil structure, how to work with different types of soils, and how to improve it. Understanding what is going on underground is your first step in creating a healthy and beautiful garden. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $44 + sp fee, register for section 002.</p>
