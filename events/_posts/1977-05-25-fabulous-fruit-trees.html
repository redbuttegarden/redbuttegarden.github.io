Learn to care for your existing trees and give new ones a healthy start as we cover planting, pruning, thinning, pollination needs, recommended varieties, and common insects and diseases. Saturday's class will meet outside; please bring loppers and pruners to this class. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $76 + sp fee; register for section 002.</p>
