<p class="text-center">Do you lack sufficient sun or garden space for a vegetable or herb garden? Many herbs and vegetables thrive in containers, which can be positioned or moved to take advantage of sunny spots. Learn which vegetables and herbs do well in containers, as well as tips to keep them producing throughout summer and into fall. You will also have the opportunity to plant the vegetables of your choice into a 15-inch container to take home.</p>
