<p class="text-center">Prepare for the cold and flu season with the power of plants! Using easy-to-find ingredients and step-by-step instructions, Ethnobotanist Heidi Simper will help you to create your own plant medicine. This class covers plant medicine basics and teaches foundational skills as you make three different types of preparations; tea, salve, and a tincture. Whether creating gifts, or stocking your own plant medicine cabinet, you will leave with a new skill set and a better understanding of how plants can help you heal. Supply lists will be provided after registration.</p>
