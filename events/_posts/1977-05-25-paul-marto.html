  <p class="text-center"><em>Glorious Nature is a stunning, visual journey detailing the beautiful, the wondrous, and the “glorious” that surround us daily. This breathtaking collection of wildlife and nature shots by award winning photographer Paul J. Marto Jr., is designed to awaken something deep within our subconscious; that yearning we all have to connect with our surroundings in a more spiritual way.</em></p>

<p class="text-center">Marto explains, “The stresses of everyday life do their best to rob us of simple pleasures like enjoying a glorious sunrise, witnessing a dramatic lightning strike or gazing upon a majestic raptor effortlessly riding the thermals. I strive to present vivid photographs that will both inspire and educate. I want my photography to serve as a constant reminder that we are not alone; that life is not all about us; that we can rejuvenate our collective souls with beauty and joy, if we only dare to take our eyes off of ourselves and truly start seeing the amazing world we live in.”</p>
