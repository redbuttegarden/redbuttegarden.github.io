<p class="text-center">When was the last time you saw a monarch butterfly? How about a milkweed plant? Join us as we discuss the symbiotic relationship of these two species and learn how we can help the threatened monarch butterfly population survive and reproduce. In this 2-hour class, students will learn from local “citizen scientists” how to propagate and grow drought-tolerant, native milkweed to attract monarch butterflies back to the community. Students will also find out about opportunities to become a citizen scientist, participating in an official migration study learning how monarchs from our area are tagged and tracked in order to record their epic journey south to Mexico or California.  Students will be provided with seeds and/or seedlings to start their own butterfly-friendly garden at home!</p>
