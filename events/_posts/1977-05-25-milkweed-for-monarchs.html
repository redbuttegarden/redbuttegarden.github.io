<p class="text-center">When was the last time you saw a monarch butterfly? How about a milkweed plant? Join us as we discuss the symbiotic relationship of these two species and learn how we can help the threatened monarch butterfly population survive and reproduce.</p>
<p class="text-center">In this one hour webinar, students will learn from a local “citizen scientist” about the state of the monarch butterfly, their lifecycle and migration, and why milkweed is so critical. Learn how to propagate and grow drought-tolerant, native milkweed to attract monarch butterflies and other pollinators back to the community. You will also learn how to get involved as a “citizen scientist” and monitor breeding habitat or tag monarchs during the migration season. Native milkweed seeds will be provided to all who register.</p>
<p class="text-center">Photos below show a monarch butterfly tagged in American Fork, Utah, and recovered after it migrated all the way to Pismo Beach, CA.</p>
