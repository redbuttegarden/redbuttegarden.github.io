<p class="text-center">When was the last time you saw a monarch butterfly? How about a milkweed plant? Join us as we discuss the symbiotic relationship of these two species and learn how we can help the threatened monarch butterfly population survive and reproduce. In this 90 minute class, students will learn from a local expert how to propagate and grow drought-tolerant, native milkweed to attract monarch butterflies back to the community.</p>
<p class="text-center">Students will also learn how to create your own Monarch waystation; and get more involved in an official study, tagging and releasing monarchs during the migration season in order to record their epic journey south to Mexico or California. Students will be sent 20-25 Showy Milkweed (asclepias speciosa)seeds ready to plant via mail. </p>
<p class="text-center">Photos below show a monarch butterfly tagged in American Fork, Utah, and recovered after it migrated all the way to Pismo Beach, CA.</p>
