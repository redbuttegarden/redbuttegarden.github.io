<p class="text-center">Houseplants add life to your home that cannot be equaled by any other home furnishing. But, just like your outdoor plants, your indoor plants need a little TLC as well. In this class, students will learn how to identify, select, and properly care for houseplants. Light, water, space, and fertilizer requirements will be discussed and design tips will be shared. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
