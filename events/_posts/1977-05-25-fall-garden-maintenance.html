<p class="text-center">Get a jump on spring gardening this fall. Simple garden clean-up along with dividing, transplanting, pruning, and mulching will leave you ahead of the game come spring. We'll discuss which perennials to cut back and which to leave until spring, tips for healthy fall transplanting, dividing irises and bulbs, which trees and shrubs can be pruned in fall, and how to protect your garden through mulching.</p>
