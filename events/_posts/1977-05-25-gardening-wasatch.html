<p class="text-center">Every region has unique growing conditions, such as climate and soils, that impact locally relevant gardening choices, and Utah is no exception. Whether you're a longtime resident or relatively new to the area, understanding the unique conditions along the Wasatch Front will better prepare you to make the right gardening choices. Topics discussed will include climatic zones, soil amendments, watering strategies, and plant selection. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
