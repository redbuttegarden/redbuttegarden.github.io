<p class="text-left">Did you know April is National Poetry Month? Every April 1 - 30, celebrate this unique literary art with a stroll through the Garden to find eleven poetry boxes featuring poems written by winners of our Spring Poetry Contest.</p>

<!--<p class="text-center">Throughout the month of April, you can also interact with our winning poets via your cell phone on a special audio tour featuring recordings of our contest winners performing readings of their poems. The audio tour is free, but normal cell phone carrier usage rates apply.</p>

<p class="text-center">To access the audio tour, follow instructions at each poetry box. Scan the QR code at each box, visit <a href="https://rbgpoetrywalk.oncell.com/en/index.html"> rbgpoetrywalk.toursphere.com</a>, or call 801-889-1770 and enter the number associated with each poem. While enjoying the tour, please be considerate of other Garden guests and listen to audio content through headphones or your phone’s earpiece.</p>
