<p class="text-center">Did you know April is National Poetry Month? From April 1 - 30, celebrate this unique literary art with a stroll through the Garden to find eleven displays featuring poems written by winners of our Spring Poetry Contest.</p>

<!--<p class="text-center">Throughout the month of April, you can also interact with our winning poets via your cell phone on a special audio tour featuring recordings of our contest winners performing readings of their poems. The audio tour is free, but normal cell phone carrier usage rates apply.</p>

<p class="text-center">To access the audio tour, follow instructions at each poetry box. Scan the QR code at each box, visit <a href="https://rbgpoetrywalk.oncell.com/en/index.html"> rbgpoetrywalk.toursphere.com</a>, or call 801-889-1770 and enter the number associated with each poem. While enjoying the tour, please be considerate of other Garden guests and listen to audio content through headphones or your phoneâ€™s earpiece.</p>
