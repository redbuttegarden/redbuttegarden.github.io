<p>Did you know that April is National Poetry Month? From April 1 - May 31, the Garden celebrates this unique literary art by hosting the poems written by our eleven local poetry contest winners in stand-up display boxes placed throughout the Garden. Look for them along your path. We feature other seasonal poems throughout the year.</p>
<!--<p>This year, we are featuring the poems on this page, and will post these poems in the Garden when we are able to open to the public.</p>-->

<p>Enter our annual <a href="/call-for-poetry/">Spring Poetry Contest.</a></p>
<p>Check back mid-March to see the list of 2021 winners of our Spring Poetry Contest.</p>
