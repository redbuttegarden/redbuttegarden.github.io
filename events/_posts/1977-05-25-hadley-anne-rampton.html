  <p class="text-center green">Meet the Artist Reception<br />
  Saturday, May 13 from 2-4PM</p>
  <br />
</div>-->

<p>I begin by painting the actual scene before me, but as the painting progresses I delve into the personality of the painting, itself. A three way dialogue forms between the natural scene, the painting, and me. Which one speaks loudest changes from moment to moment, and, if any one becomes dominant for too long, the work can fail. It is the balance between the three that keeps me engaged.
  My paintings are a direct response to my environment and to my existence in it.</p>
