  Saturday, May 13 from 2-4PM</p>

<p>Hadley Rampton paints oils en plein air (outside) throughout the mountains and deserts of the Intermountain West with a contemporary, palette knife approach.
  When traveling overseas, she explores streets and off-the-beaten-path hidden treasures, capturing her impressions in watercolor and ink. Paintings in each media will be on display. </p>
