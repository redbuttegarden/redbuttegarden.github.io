<p class="text-center">Do you wander the aisles of the garden center and become overwhelmed by all of the choices? Before spending hundreds of dollars, would you like to know what that tree will look like in ten years? This class is for you. Join us for this three season course as we look at 101 truly remarkable plants suited for the Wasatch Front garden. We will cover plants starting with spring bulbs and concluding with trees and shrubs with great fall color. Each class will focus on identification, cultural requirements, and how plants are best used in the garden. We will walk the Garden each class to take an up close and personal look at the plants as they are discussed. Perfect for novice gardeners and plant enthusiasts alike, the course is sure to widen your plant palette and introduce you to some truly amazing plants! All but the first class meets on 2nd Thursday of the month. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $162 + sp fee; register for section 002.</p>
