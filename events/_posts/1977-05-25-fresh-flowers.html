<p class="text-center">Quarantine got you down?  Climbing the walls because youâ€™re going stir crazy?  Needing a creative outlet? Well, this may be the perfect time to take an informal beginning floral design class.  Each month students will learn a different style of design & themes, with a highlighted seasonal flower of the month.  Learn how to turn a grocery store bouquet into a beautiful centerpiece.  Designer, Scott Mower will share some helpful tips and the basics of floral design.</p>
<p class="text-center">Registration covers material costs. Students will be able to pick up flowers and a container the day before class at Red Butte Garden. (containers may be used again in following classes)
Other Items needed: Pruners and Gloves (optional)</p>
