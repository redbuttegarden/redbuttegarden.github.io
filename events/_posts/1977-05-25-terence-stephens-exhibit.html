<p class="text-center">Floralissima</p>

<p class="text-center">Floral art and landscapes have always been a fascination for me. The organic shapes, the patterns, textures and the colors in nature are an essential part of my art. When I walk my dog, I notice the yards in my neighborhood and notice what is growing. When I travel, I look at the fauna to see what makes that place special and different. I only paint what I experience personally, whether it be nature or people.</a></p>
