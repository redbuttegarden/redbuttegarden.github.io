<p class="text-center">Looking for a centerpiece that is as much at home on the dining room table as it is on the patio or deck? Look no further than the world of succulents! Part lecture, part workshop, this class will first teach general identification, care and propagation techniques of the most popular succulents grown today as well as basic principles of design, followed by a workshop where you will create your very own succulent centerpiece. Tools, container, succulents, and all the encouragement you need will be provided. Co-Sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
