<p>I have always been an artist. At 50, I got restless. Adventures in nature, with family, became a priority. Skiing, scuba diving, hiking, camping, we were always on the move. Then I discovered plein air, outdoor painting from real life. Combining my favorite passions... nature and creating art.</p>
