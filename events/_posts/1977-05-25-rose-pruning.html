<p class="text-center">Roses are among the most loved and versatile of garden plants, yet many gardeners are intimidated by the enormous range of species and hybrids with their varying requirements for pruning. Join us as we demystify rose pruning in this hands-on workshop designed to help you get the very best out of your roses. Wear appropriate clothing and bring gloves and hand pruners. Limited to 12. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $40 + sp fee; register for section 002 or 004.</p>
