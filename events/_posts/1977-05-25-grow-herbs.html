<p class="text-center">Tired of paying top dollar for fresh herbs, but don't want to miss out on the flavor burst only fresh herbs can give you? Time to grow your own! Whether you are planning a new culinary herb garden or improving an existing one, this class will help you get the most from your plot. We'll cover site and soil preparation, garden design, which herbs to plant, planting from seed versus cuttings, planting schedule, common pests and how to discourage them by inter-planting flowers, water and sun needs, and harvesting and storage. Each student will measure and plot their garden as we talk about space requirements for dozens of common edible herbs. We will also discuss cooking with fresh herbs.
