			<p>Directed and written by Jordan Peele</p>
			<p>Rated R, 114 minutes</p>

		<p>Now that Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), have reached the meet-the-parents milestone of dating, she invites him for a weekend getaway upstate with Missy and Dean. At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined.

			<p>Directed by Fernando Grostein Andrade </p>
			<p>Not Rated, 85 minutes</p>

			<p>Finding one’s identity is a challenge everyone faces, but few have the pressure that 12-year-old Abe feels as the son of an Israeli mother and Palestinian father. Thankfully, Abe's passion for food allows him some escape from the escalating family tensions. While exploring Brooklyn to discover new foods, he meets Chico, a Brazilian chef who believes “mixing flavors can bring people together.” Abe decides to plan a Thanksgiving feast that celebrates his diverse heritage, with the hope of unifying his family.</p>

			<h4 class="text-center">EIGHTH GRADE</h4>
			<h5 class="text-center green">Wednesday, July 17 - Gates open at 7:30PM, film at dusk (approx 9PM)</h5>

			<p>Directed and written by Bo Burnham </p>
			<p>Rated R, 94 minutes </p>

			<p>Eighth-grader Kayla Day always has her phone in hand, hoping to find connections online that might make up for those she’s unable to forge in everyday life. She makes YouTube videos aimed at other adolescents dealing with similar issues—feelings of isolation, anxiety, and invisibility—but Kayla finds her advice paralyzingly difficult to apply in real situations. In the final week of a thus-far-disastrous school year—and with high school looming on the horizon—Kayla struggles to bridge the gap between how she perceives herself and who she believes she should be.</p>

			<p>A flamboyant ensemble of gender-bending hippies, the Cockettes created a series of LSD-fueled musicals in early-1970s San Francisco. These all-singing, all-dancing extravaganzas featured outrageous costumes, rebellious sexuality, and exuberant chaos.</p>
      <p>The screening will be preceded by a conversation and Q&A with co-director David Weissman.</p>
