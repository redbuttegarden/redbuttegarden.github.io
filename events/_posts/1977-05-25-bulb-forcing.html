<p class="text-center">Brighten the winter blues by planting spring bulbs in pots for winter forcing. We will share the secrets of successful bulb forcing as participants plant a combination of bulbs into containers to take home which will grow into small potted spring gardens. Participants will be provided with all the necessary materials including pots, soil, selected bulbs and instructions for forcing. </p>
