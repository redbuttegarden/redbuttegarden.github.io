<p class="text-center">Looking for a centerpiece that is as much at home on the dining room table as it is on the patio or deck. Look no further than the world of succulents! Part lecture, part demonstration, this class will first teach general identification, care and propagation techniques of the most popular succulents grown today as well as basic principles of design, followed by a demonstration where you will follow along to create your very own succulent centerpiece. A list of tools, container, succulents, and all the encouragement you need will be provided before class. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
