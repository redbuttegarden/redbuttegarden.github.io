<p class="text-center">THE SHADE OF IT ALL...
Do you have more shade than sunlight and struggle keeping those sun loving plants alive? Then lets embrace our shadier side and create and plant a living wreath mixed with shade loving ferns and grasses!
Heavy with texture and cool colors of green, white, yellows and blue. When done, our shady wreaths will do well in dabbled sunlight or deep shade suitable for your outdoor living space or indoors as a beautiful centerpiece, that will make any sun lover envious!</p>
