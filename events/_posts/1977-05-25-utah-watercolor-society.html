<p class="text-left">The Utah Watercolor Society was founded December 30, 1974, and operates as a Utah Non-profit Corporation and Cooperative Association. The mission of UWS is to promote the advancement of the art of painting watercolors, and to hold annual exhibitions of watercolors. We promote artists continual growth as individuals and as a group, and strive to maintain exhibits of the highest professional quality.</p>
