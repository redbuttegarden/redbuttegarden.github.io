<p class="text-center">Spend a morning creating a beautiful, living, succulent wreath. These versatile wreaths can grace your garden, become the dramatic center-piece that sets the mood for a special dinner, or a holiday accent for a door or a mantel. We'll send a material list before class so you can follow along. We will cover care and maintenance of your living wreath. You're sure to become the envy of the neighborhood with this statement of true living beauty. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning; members pay $35 (ask for section 002).</p>
