<p class="text-center">Discover different species of bulbs and receive design tips to help you make appropriate bulb selections for your garden and ensure beautiful color throughout the spring. You will also learn basic bulb anatomy, when and where to plant, how to care for a bulb collection and where to purchase. This class meets during early and mid-spring peak bloom, first Tuesday evening online and then Saturday for a socially-distanced garden walk to see bulbs in person.
