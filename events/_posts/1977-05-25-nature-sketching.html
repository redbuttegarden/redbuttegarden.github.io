<p class="text-center">In this class, you will learn sketching and quick painting techniques using blue pencil, graphite and watercolor pencils. The focus of this class will be wildflowers, and a field trip has been planned on Saturday, July 29th, to Albion Basin to attend the wildflower festival, which includes a beginner’s hike (level ground) with an experienced wildflower tour leader. A wonderful experience!</p>
