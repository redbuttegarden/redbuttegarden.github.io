  <p class="text-center bold">Meet the Artist Reception<br />
  Saturday, August 18 from 1-4PM</p>

</div>

<p class="text-center">The rugged beauty of Utah has always been enchanting to me as a lifelong resident and artist. Every time I venture into the desert or explore mountain trails, I’m inspired by the amazing wildlife and landscape that surround me. Nature is my muse and I humbly try to capture its beauty on canvas.

<p class="text-center">“It’s not what you look at that matters... it’s what you see.” - Henry David Thoreau </p>

<p class="text-center">This show is dedicated to my lifelong friend Leigh Ann Givens.</p>
