<h4 class="green">Art By Design</h4>
<p>A native of Salt Lake City, Utah, I studied art and design at the University of Utah. I received my Bachelors of Fine Art Degree in 1978. My post-graduate work was at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. This experience had a profound influence on me as art and design merged into one.</p>
