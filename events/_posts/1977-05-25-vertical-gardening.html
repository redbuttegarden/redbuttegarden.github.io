<br />

<p class="text-center">We all want exquisite gardens, but time-crunched lifestyles, shrinking spaces and a commitment to sustainable choices is changing our definition of what a garden can be. Take your garden to the next level by discovering its vertical spaces. Filled with inspiring photos and innovative approaches, this class will highlight a range of vertical gardening ideas from living walls to upright vegetable gardens. Each participant will have the opportunity to plant a small woolypocket to take home and begin their vertical gardening adventure. All materials provided. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $35 + sp fee, register for section 002.</p>
