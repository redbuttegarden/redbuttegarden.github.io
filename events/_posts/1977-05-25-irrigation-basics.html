<p class="text-center">Whether your landscaping involves waterwise plantings, plants that require regular water, or a combination of the two, using the right irrigation for your landscape can substantially reduce water use while helping your garden flourish. Explore smart irrigation practices that give plants the water they need to thrive (no more, no less) and deliver that water in the most efficient way possible. Class will focus on maintenance of existing irrigation systems and troubleshooting common problems, and other topics to enhance your home irrigation system. Interested in learning how to convert overhead to drip irrigation, register for Drip Irrigation -- How to Switch to Drip. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $45 + sp fee; register for section 002.</p>
