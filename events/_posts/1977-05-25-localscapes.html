        <p class="text-center green">Creating a good landscape plan is one of the most important steps to achieving a beautiful and functional landscape. If you’ve taken Localscapes University but want extra help laying out your design, this workshop will get your ideas onto paper. We’ll walk you through a guided design process that covers the elements of a Localscape and the basics of planting bed design without getting into the details like selecting individual plants. Each attendee should leave with a basic Localscapes design drawn to-scale.

Requirements:

1. Attendees are required to have attended a Localscapes University.

2. Attendees must come prepared with a base map of their property drawn to scale. </p>
