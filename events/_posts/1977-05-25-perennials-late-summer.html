<p class="text-center">You shopped for perennials in the spring and purchased plants based on the beautiful blooms currently on display but forgot to consider your garden design for late summer and fall. Proper planning can give you color and blooms from early spring until frost. Slides, pictures, and discussion will help you select perennials best suited to your individual landscape. We'll also cover design, soil preparation, planting, and maintenance. A complement to Perennials: Spring and Summer Bloomers. Register for both for a long beautiful season. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Garden members register for section 002.</p><br />
