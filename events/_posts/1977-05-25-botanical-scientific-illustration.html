<p class="text-center">Perfecting Perspective:</p>
<p class="text-center">Do you shy away from the complicated plants? Even experienced illustrators sometimes struggle with foreshortening and simplify their subjects to eliminate the tricky parts. Learn the techniques and tricks for seeing and depicting perspective accurately. Whether determining the correct shape of an ellipse or finding the angle of the element pointing to you, you’ll work with botanical subjects that demonstrate each aspect of perspective. The class will work entirely in graphite pencil, as the principles apply to all other media. Gain confidence in your drafting skills and improve your drawings from this class forward.</p>
