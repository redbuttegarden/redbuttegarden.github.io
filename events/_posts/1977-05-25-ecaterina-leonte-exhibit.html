<p>For lack of a better word I call them mandalas. 'Fractal Art' would be the proper term but that sounds harsh and uninviting. Besides, working on these pieces was somewhat of a meditative processâ€”in search of the element that would serve as the base photo for a mandala, I found myself walking with purpose and seeing with intention. I listened to myself, argued with myself, went against myself and made peace with myself. Long walks are good for the soul. </p>

<p>On some days I would walk the paths of Red Butte Garden for six hours straight. I would frantically take photos of everything hoping that, by chance, some of them would turn into beautiful mandalas. I ended up deleting most of them, but the process helped me understand what to look for. In a photo, at least. </p>
