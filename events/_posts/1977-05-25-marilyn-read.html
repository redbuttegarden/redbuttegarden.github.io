<h4 class="text-center green">Artist Bio</h4>
<p class="text-center">My love of art began in elementary school in Ogden, Utah, where I first discovered the magic of painting. While attending art classes at the University of Hawaii on Oahu, the vibrancy of tropical light and color influenced my art with its bold, saturated color.  Hawaii also shaped another element of my painting in an enduring way. Exposure to mid-eastern and Asian art gave me an alternative to "realistic" Renaissance perspective in landscape. I adopted instead a flattened perspective and the simple, stylized form of Japanese woodblock prints and Persian miniatures. </p>
<p class="text-center">After graduation from the University of Hawaii, with a teaching degree in art, I returned to Utah. I have taught in public schools as well as privately at King's Cottage Art School, Art Access Gallery and Lifelong Learning. I also volunteered as an art facilitator at the Trauma Awareness and Treatment Center in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p class="text-center">I received my BFA from the University of Utah in 1998 with an emphasis in painting and drawing. Since then I have exhibited in numerous juried Utah shows, including the Springville Museum of Arts. Solo exhibits include the Salt Lake Main Library, Pioneer Theater Company, Bountiful Davis Art Center, and most recently, the Paul Redd-Butterfield Gallery in Helper, Utah. </p>
<p class="text-center">I'm delighted for the opportunity to exhibit at Red Butte Garden, where I have painted on many occasions and intend to continue doing so as a favorite subject for this upcoming show.</p>
