<p class="text-center">Follow the cascade of wildflower blooms across Northern Utah. We'll begin at Red Butte Garden with some classroom time and then hike into the foothills for a look at spring's first blooms. We'll continue to follow the wildflower bloom each class and will culminate our experience in the subalpine zone of the Albion Basin at the end of July. We'll spend the first half hour of each class learning about plant families and the plant communities located in the area we'll be visiting. Please bring a notebook to record your findings. Five classes.</p>
