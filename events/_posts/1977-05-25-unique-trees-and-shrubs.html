<p class="text-center">Looking for a tree or shrub a little out of the ordinary that can grow well in Utah's climate? Join us to examine unique specimens in a garden setting and discuss best planting, growing and maintenance practices for each selection. We'll cover trees and shrubs that can be planted in a residential setting and perform well in our alkaline soil, hot summers, and cold winters. Majority of class is spent outdoors so dress appropriately and wear comfortable shoes for walking. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
