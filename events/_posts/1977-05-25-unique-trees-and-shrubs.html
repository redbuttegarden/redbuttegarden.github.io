<p class="text-center">Looking for a tree or shrub a little out of the ordinary that can grow well in Utah's climate? Join us to examine unique specimens and discuss best planting, growing and maintenance practices for each selection. We'll cover trees and shrubs that can be planted in a residential setting and perform well in our alkaline soil, hot summers, and cold winters. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
