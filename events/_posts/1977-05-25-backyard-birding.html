<p>Located on the north/south migration routes for many birds, the Great Salt Lake and the lakes, rivers, and creeks in the surrounding mountains provide a mecca for birdwatchers.
  Pack a picnic, a birding book, and your binoculars and take a morning walk or hike in the foothills for great opportunities to spot our feathered friends.
  Can you name all the regular bird visitors in your own back yard?</p>

      <p class="text-center">Wear muted clothing. Avoid wearing stark white- it can startle away many birds. Speak softly, walk slowly, make no sudden gestures. Stop often or find a shady place to sit and watch.</p>
