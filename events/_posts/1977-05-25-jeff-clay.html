  Friday, September 14 from 6:30-8:30PM</p>

<p class="text-center">Artist Statement: A rose is a rose is a rose … except when it may be something else.</p>
<p class="text-center">I’ve always enjoyed photographing flowers. Whether in botanical gardens, walking though local neighborhoods, or when traveling overseas, the brilliant variety of flowers attracts me. A straight flower photograph can be a thing of beauty: colorful, full of sharp detail, perhaps with an accompanying insect…usually a happy, straightforward portrait of nature. In 2013 I traveled to Monet’s Garden outside Paris. I walked into the gardens and immediately began photographing the riot of floral colors much as I always had. But then I realized: a tulip – whether in Giverny, France, or Red Butte, Utah – is ‘just’ a tulip. I was in the garden of a master of Impressionism and all I could do is photograph a flower, as I would shoot a building? Instead I began using movement, longer and multiple exposures to create ‘floral impressions.’ These I further enhanced when processing the images.
To this day I still use a number of different tools, techniques, and treatments to capture and render flowers. They are presented as
‘something else.’ From near-abstract to painterly representations: Floral Impressions. </p>
