<p class="text-center">Succulents and terrariums are popular these days. Combined, they create very low maintenance terrarium with the ultimate plant to create an unusual centerpiece, a dramatic accent or a colorful breath of summer while it’s cold outside. We’ll provide the terrarium, soil, amendments, succulent plants, and other materials. Students will pick up material kits prior to class at Red Butte Garden. We'll also cover how to care for and maintain your terrarium.</p>
