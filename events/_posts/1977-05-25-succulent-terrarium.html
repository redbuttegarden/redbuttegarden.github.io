<p class="text-center">Succulents and terrariums are popular these days. Combined, they create very low maintenance terrarium with the ultimate plant to create an unusual centerpiece, a dramatic accent or a colorful breath of summer while it’s cold outside. We’ll provide the terrarium, soil, amendments, succulent plants, and other materials. We'll also cover how to care for and maintain your terrarium.</p>
