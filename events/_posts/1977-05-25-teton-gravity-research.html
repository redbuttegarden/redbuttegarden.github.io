<p class="text-center"><b>Thanks for making this event such a success! Check back this summer for the 2020 TGR Premiere Film!</b></p>

<!--<br />
<h3 class="text-center green">2019 FILM SCREENING - WINTERLAND<br /></h3>
<p class="text-center">Wednesday, September 18. Gates open at 6PM. Film will begin around 8 - 8:30PM.</p>

<p class="text-center">Teton Gravity Research is returning to Red Butte Garden Amphitheatre for the winter kick-off party of the year. Join us for a one-night only premiere of their new 2019 feature length ski and snowboard film, <b>Winterland</b>. Bring the blankets and coolers and join us to see Winterland on the big screen.

<br />

<p class="text-center"><b>Come prepared for the weather!</b> Even the warmest days in September can get pretty chilly when the sun goes down in the Amphitheatre at the mouth of Red Butte Canyon. Film is rain or shine (pending lightning, high winds, or torrential downpour).</p>

<br />

<p class="text-center">As always, this event is BYOB - grab your low-back chairs, blankets, and coolers and come out for a great time in an incredible setting.</p>

<br />

<p class="text-center">Come early for live local music with alternative reggae band <a href="http://herbanempire.com/">Herban Empire</a>. There will be athlete appearances and a ton of prizes from their partners at Atomic, Volkl, The North Face and many more.</p>

<p class="text-center"><b>About the film:</b> WINTERLAND celebrates our athletesâ€™ connection to the roots of skiing and snowboarding while showcasing the pure joy that is found in the place where earth and sky collide. By exploring the history, places, and people, we learn how intimately connected we are with those who came before. This story of adventure and passion is far from over, as TGR's modern day pioneers are eager to etch their names in the annals of history.  Follow these individuals as they leave their own mark on fabled locations and chase the ghosts of the greats who came before them.</p>
