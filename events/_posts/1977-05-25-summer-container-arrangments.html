<p class="text-center">Make a bold statement on your patio or porch this summer by planting a colorful assortment of annuals, perennials, and tropicals into your decorative pots and planters.  Learn how to choose vibrant color combinations all while gaining a general knowledge of plant needs and care. You will learn which plants require full sun, part sun, part shade or full shade and the difference between annuals and perennials. Give your houseplants a summer vacation and take them outdoors and incorporate them into your summer container designs. Class will be taught online using Zoom and a list of class materials will be sent out beforehand in order for students to follow along with designer and horticulturist, Scott Mower. </p>
