Poets of all ages are invited to enter original, spring-inspired poems from January 6 through February 15. Eleven lucky winners will have their poems displayed in the Garden throughout April to help celebrate National Poetry Month. Winners will also receive a prize package perfectly suited for aspiring authors and poets of all ages.</p>
