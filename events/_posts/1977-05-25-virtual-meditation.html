<p class="text-center">Take a moment for yourself during the work week and join Maurena in the Garden for a moment of Mindfulness. Maurena tends to focus on mindfulness meditation, but often adds a little bit of self-compassion and loving-kindness to the practice. Mindfulness Meditation can be practiced while sitting, standing, lying down, or walking.</p>
<p class="text-center">“Mindfulness is awareness that arises through paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally.” Jon Kabat-Zinn, the founder of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction</p>
