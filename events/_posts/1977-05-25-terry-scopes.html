  <p class="text-center bold">Meet the Artist Reception<br />
  Saturday, August 3 from 2-4PM</p>

</div>

<p class="text-center">I am an abstract expressionist artist. I respond intuitively and spontaneously to nature, painting the rich hues and organic shapes around me from an emotional perspective. I paint how what I see makes me feel.

I want viewersâ€™ first take of my paintings to be one of the big picture. On the second take I want them to become curious by the subtle marks and patinas, which, to me is a sweet reward for them looking closer and exploring. It is an invitation to feel as well as see.

All of my paintings are acrylic/mixed media works on canvas. In addition to paint, I use graphite, oil pastels, ink, and charcoal to add variety and contrast to my mark making in order to create a surface finish that adds a sense of story, history, and mystery to the work... a quiet back story to each piece. </p>
