  <p class="text-center bold">Meet the Artist Reception<br />
  Saturday, July 22 from 1-4PM</p>

</div>-->

<p class="text-center">Artist Statement: I have lived many years in Salt Lake City, Utah, where I pursue art for fun as well as a part-time career.  Many of my watercolor landscapes still have a tinge of New England in them--the influence remaining from my younger years growing up in Palmer, Massachusetts.
I have taught watercolor and art classes for over 15 years, sometimes as many as 6 classes a week. Each class is exciting in it's own way--from beginning students to advanced "open studio" classes.</p>
