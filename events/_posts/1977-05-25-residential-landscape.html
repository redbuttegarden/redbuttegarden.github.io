We'll show you how to draw a plan; analyze your site; and use landscape design principles for laying out paths, patios, and garden beds suitable for your site. We'll use Red Butte Garden to look at plants appropriate for the Utah landscape and learn about plant characteristics to consider when choosing plants for your garden design. You'll have the opportunity to work on your personal landscape plan throughout class with the help of a landscape designer. Co-sponsored with Red Butte Garden.
