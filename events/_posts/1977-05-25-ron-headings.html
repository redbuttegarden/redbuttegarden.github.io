  <p class="text-center bold">Meet the Artist Reception<br />
  Saturday, May 26 from 2-4PM</p>

</div>

<p class="text-center">Ron Headings, 58, began creating wire trees as a teenager in Kansas. Inspired by his love of horticulture and the coaching of a local horticulture extension agent, Ron has refined his work with wire and rock over the years.</p>

<p class="text-center">Trees are like people, the forest like humanity. They come in an infinate number of colors, shapes, and sizes - each one is beautiful in it's own way. The trees, like people, are shaped by their genetic structure and the environment in which they live.</p>

<p class="text-center">Trees are created as a certain species with a variety of characteristics.  Then they are changed by the locations in which they live, the amount of water and nutrients they receive, and the impact of wind and weather.</p>
