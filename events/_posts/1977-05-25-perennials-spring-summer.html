<p class="text-center">Walk the aisles of any garden center in spring, and you'll find yourself in the midst of a cornucopia of scent and color. The sign says "perennials", and you know which ones appeal to you, but what else do you know about them? We can help! Whether you are starting a new garden or refreshing an existing one, you'll want to select plants suited to your individual landscape and to pick combinations that offer color and blooms from early spring until frost. Through slides, discussion, and garden walks, we will show you the characteristics of a diverse group of perennials suited to Utah gardens. This class will focus on perennials that bloom in spring and summer. For perennials that bloom late summer and fall, please take Perennials: Late Summer - Fall Bloomers. We'll also cover design, soil preparation, planting, and maintenance. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
