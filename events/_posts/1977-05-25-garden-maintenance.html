<p class="text-center">Gardens grow, and that can be both a blessing and a curse. The fresh young blooms of spring fade, stalks bend and droop, groundcover runs amok, and spent flowers turn brown on their stems. What's a gardener to do? With a little maintenance know-how, you can extend the bloom of some favorite perennials, get a second bloom from others, control invasive plantings, prop or strengthen weak stems, and overall neaten your summer and fall garden. Join us as we demonstrate deadheading, pruning, thinning, dividing, and transplanting--and keep your garden looking grand all season long. Co-sponsored by Lifelong Learning.</p>
