<p class="text-center">Gardens grow, and that can be both a blessing and a curse. The fresh young blooms of spring fade, stalks bend and droop, groundcover runs amok, and spent flowers turn brown on their stems. What's a gardener to do? With a little maintenance know-how, you can extend the bloom of some favorite perennials, get a second bloom from others, control invasive plantings, prop or strengthen weak stems, and overall neaten your summer and fall garden. Join us for three evenings in the garden as we get hands-on experience deadheading, pruning, thinning, dividing, and transplanting--and keep your garden looking grand all season long. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $68, register for section 002</p>
