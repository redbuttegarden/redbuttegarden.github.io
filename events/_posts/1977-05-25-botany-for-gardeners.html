<p class="text-center">Don't go dormant this winter! Join us as we learn basic plant morphology and terminology--knowledge that will help you better understand plant growth and take some of the guesswork out of gardening. In this hands-on class, you'll learn why some shrubs are pruned immediately after flowering while others are pruned in late winter/early spring; how to tell a pine from a spruce and why it matters; the reasons behind the differing watering practices for turf and trees, and other common gardening questions. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members py $69 +sp fee; register for section 002.</p>
