	<h4 class="text-center bold">Thanks for making the Block Party a success! Check back in spring 2020 for information about the next event.</h4>

	<!--<h4 class="text-center bold">Experience the Garden in a whole new way at our 2019 Block Party.</h4>-->
	<p class="text-center">Join us for an unforgettable evening filled with games, nature-inspired crafts, Garden-wide scavenger hunts, and more. </p>
	<p class="text-center">Bring a picnic dinner to enjoy as you listen to live local music <!--with the <i>Main Street Revelators</i>--> and soak up the beauty of summer in the Garden. Then, sit back and relax as you watch a late-night screening of <b>2020 film to be announced</b> on the Amphitheatre lawn, complete with a free tasty treat or two. </p>
	<p class="text-center">Don’t miss out on this fun-filled night in the Garden. Perfect for families, friends, date-night, and more.</p>
	<br />
	<p class="text-center bold">WHAT TO BRING</p>
	<p class="text-center">Be sure to bring low-back chairs and blankets. Hats or umbrellas to block the sun are always a good idea. You are welcome to bring a cooler and pack your own picnic and beverages of choice. </p>
	<p class="text-center">Even on the hottest summer days, the Amphitheatre is located at the mouth of Red Butte Canyon and it can get chilly after sundown, so bring a jacket and other warm layers to stay cozy during the movie. </p>
	<p class="text-center">No cooking or barbeques allowed. Please pack out whatever you bring into the venue.</p>
