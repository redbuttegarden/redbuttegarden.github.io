<p class="text-center">Every fall, Red Butte Garden volunteers and staff plant additional bulbs throughout the Garden, including an astounding 42,000 in the Water Conservation Garden in 2018, bringing up the total to a colorful array of over 500,000 blooming bulbs! Of those over 230,000 are daffodils. Other bulbs include <em>Allium, Anemone, Calochortus, Camassia, Chionodoxa, Cyclamen, Erythronium, Fritillaria, Galanthus, Hyacinth, Hyacinthoides, Ipheion, Iris, Leucojum, Muscari, Scilla, Triteleia,</em> and more. Further complimenting the blooming bulbs are blossoming trees, shrubs, and vines such as Magnolia, Flowering Pear, Crabapple, Hawthorn, Viburnum, Wisteria, Foxtail Lily, Lilac, and more!</p>

<p class="text-center">Since 2013, Red Butte Garden has been recognized as an Official Display Garden by the American Daffodil Society. Our display includes 157 different cultivars from all 13 official divisions recognized by the Royal Horticultural Society of England. Our display also includes 14 recipients of the Wister and Panil Awards, which recognizes outstanding American hybridizers and daffodil selections.</p>

<p class="text-center">In mid-March, thousands of miniature bulbs including Reticulated Iris, Siberian Squill, and Glory-of-the-Snow are not to be missed in the Rose Garden. The miniature bulbs are soon followed by thousands of daffodils and other blooming bulbs throughout the Garden.</p>
