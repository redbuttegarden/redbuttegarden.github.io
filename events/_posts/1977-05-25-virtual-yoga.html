<p class="text-center">Join Kristin Vance with Fluid Heart Yoga for a month of unlimited virtual yoga classes. Classes are held every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday with the sights and sounds of Red Butte Garden. Yoga classes are intended for all levels of practice, designed to move energy through the body with breathing techniques, guided movement and dynamic sequencing.</p>

<p><strong>Vinyasa</strong>: Vinyasa or Flow is a style of yoga that links movement and breath. Poses are woven together in a flow-like series that allow the practitioner to move to the rhythm and guidance of their own breath. These classes can be modified to fit a beginner or a seasoned practice.</p>
<p><strong>Restorative:</strong> Deep and slow movements provide the body with prolonged relaxation and restoration.</p>
<p><strong>Yoga Nidra:</strong> Guided meditations - self understanding, self discovery.</p>
