<h4 class="text-center green">Artist Bio</h4>
<p class="text-center">Tatiana was born in Colombia and immigrated to the United States 20 years ago. Before immigrating to America, she took up Batik art, an Indonesian discipline involving the production of dyeing colored patterns using beeswax onto a canvass. Her patterns depict the flora and fauna of her native South America, with beautiful images of plants, flowers, and especially tropical birds.“I really love my birds,” says Tatiana. “The Batik art is difficult and a challenge, but I love doing it.”</p>
