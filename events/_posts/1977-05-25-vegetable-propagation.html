<p class="text-center">While it's possible to have a fine vegetable garden by buying young plants, starting your own veggies from seed is less expensive, offers more varieties, and allows you to harvest your favorite edibles over a longer period of time. Come explore the worlds of seed starting and propagation as we learn which vegetables to start indoors, why some do better outdoors, when to start them, and how to nurture particular types of seedlings for maximum success. Our first session will cover the major factors and techniques that go into growing your own vegetable startsâ€”lighting, heat, day length, soil, hardening off, seed sources, varieties, germination and timing. During the second class, students will practice specialized techniques such as scarifying, transplanting, pinching and take home a tray of vegetable seeds to get a jump on the growing season.
