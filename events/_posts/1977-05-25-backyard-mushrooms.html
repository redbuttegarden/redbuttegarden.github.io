<p class="text-center">Learn about the world of outdoor mushroom cultivation and how easy it can be at your very own home with Ryan Thomas. This class will go over the basics of understanding mushrooms, various outdoor cultivation methods, how to choose the right location in your yard, and different types that you can grow right outside of your house. We will even be going over a very easy method that people can utilize if they live in an apartment with a balcony. </p>
<p class="text-center">The optional material add on will include everything you need to make a 3'x3' mushroom bed to grow your very own blue oyster mushrooms! All you will need is a shady spot in your yard. If you don't have the space or you live in an apartment with a balcony then don't worry. The same supplies will allow you to grow them out of a simple 5 gallon bucket which we will be going over in class. Whether you decide to add on materials or just want to join the class without out, I will be providing a list of resources to supply your own at the end of class.</p>
