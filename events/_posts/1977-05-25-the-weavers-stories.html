<h3 class="text-center">Adopt-A-Native-Elder Presents:<br />THE WEAVERS' STORIES</h3>

<br />
<p class="text-center">2017 CNN Hero and Founder of Adopt-A-Native-Elder, Linda Myers, will speak about her 30-year experience of serving traditional Elders living on the Navajo Reservation.
  Ms. Myers will share personal stories of the women who rely on weaving as a powerful tool in their fight against poverty. Elderly Navajo often struggle living on their own in very remote areas
  of the Reservation. Most of the traditional weavers are over 80 years old.
