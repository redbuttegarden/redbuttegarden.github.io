<!--<p class="text-center">What plant requires no soil in which to grow, and doesnâ€™t require a routine watering schedule? </p>
<p class="text-center">Why it's a Tillandsia, of course! Sign up for this new class and learn how to grow and care for air plants (Tillandsia), a new indoor trend! Just as easy if not easier than succulents, Tillandsias just may be that forget about it, no brainer plant your looking for. In this class we will learn about these epiphytic wonders and create an exotic arrangement for home or office that is sure to last for a very long time! Students will pick up class materials prior to class at Red Butte Garden.</p>-->

<p class="text-center">Come learn about the vast varieties of air plants, and how to care for them. Nate will be showing his award winning design and will teach you how to make your own unique and beautiful air plant displays. Material pick up will be at Red Butte Garden on February 25. </p>
