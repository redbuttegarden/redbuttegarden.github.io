<h3><b>TICKET SCALPING</b></h3>

<p>Be aware that other ticket vendors and scalpers use the words 'Red Butte' in some way to sell tickets. We recommend that you only purchase your tickets online through <a href="http://www.redbuttegarden.org" title="www.redbuttegarden.org">www.redbuttegarden.org</a> or <a href="http://www.ticketfly.com" title="www.ticketfly.com">www.ticketfly.com</a>.</p>

<p>Purchasers of Red Butte Garden concert and event tickets may not resell their tickets for more than the face value of the ticket ("scalping"). Purchasers who are caught scalping their tickets may be subject to ejection from the Red Butte Garden event, may have their tickets confiscated, and may be banned from the future purchase of tickets to Red Butte Garden events. <a href="/concert-terms-conditions">CLICK HERE</a> to see all of the Terms &amp; Conditions that apply to your concert ticket ("license"). </p>
