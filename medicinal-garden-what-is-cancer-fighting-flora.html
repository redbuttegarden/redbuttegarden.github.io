		<h4 class="text-center green">WHAT IS CANCER?</h4>

<br />

<p>Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues. This uncontrolled growth can occur because cells are dividing and multiplying more quickly than normal (mitosis), or because cells are not dying when they normally would (apoptosis).</p>

<br />

		<h4 class="text-center green">CANCER IS A GLOBAL CONCERN</h4>

<br />

<p>Cancer has a significant impact globally and is among the leading causes of death worldwide with 18.1 million new cases in 2018 - 1.7 million of those in the United States. Approximately 38.4% of people will be diagnosed with some type of cancer in their lifetime.</p>

<p>While the number of cancer diagnosises are increasing, the overall cancer death rate is decreasing. More people are surviving cancer and cancer treatment. This is largely due to research and technology that have led to better prevention, detection, treatment, and post treatment care.</p>

		<h4 class="text-center green">PLANTS ARE PART OF THE STRATEGY TO FIGHT CANCER</h4>

<br />

<p>In the 1960s, the National Cancer Institute began efforts to strategically evaluate plants for cancer fighting potential. As of 2016, humans have documented knowledge of about 391,000 plant species, with about 2000 species being discovered each year. Imagine how many more species of plants might exist in the world that have not been indentified! How many of these undiscovered plants hold answers to curing and preventing cancer? What can we do to help in the search to find the answers in these plants?</p>
