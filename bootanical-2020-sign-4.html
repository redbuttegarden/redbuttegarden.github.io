<h4 class="text-center"><i>Asclepias tuberosa</i></center></h4>

<h5 class="text-center">Milkweed Family</center></h5></p>
<br />

<p class="text-center">This Utah native features bright orange flowers atop upright hairy stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Unlike many of the other milkweeds, this species does not have milky-sapped stems. Seed pods are spindle shaped and split open when ripe with numerous silky-tailed seeds.  </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">While this species has a lower toxicity than other Milkweeds, if ingested in large doses, all parts of this plant are poisonous. It causes vomiting, stupor, weakness, fever, difficulty breathing, and spasms. </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">The genus <i>Asclepias</i> is named after the Greek god of medicine, <i>Asklepios</i>. It has been used medicinally for centuries. The amount of medicinal uses within this genus is astounding. Butterfly Weed has been used by both physicians and Native Americans to treat breathing difficulties and fevers.  </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">This is a wonderful addition to any yard as it provides a food source to monarchs and nectar for a wide variety of pollinators, and not to mention its vibrant blooms and year-round interest. </p>
