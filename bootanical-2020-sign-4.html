<p class="text-center">Amongst all of the yellow asters, the genus Arnica is generally easy to identify. It is the only genus that regularly has opposite, simple leaves, and hair-like bristles topping the fruits. As its name suggests, the leaves of this perennial species are heart-shaped. The outer “petals” which are actually individual flowers called ray flowers, are bright yellow and the center flowers, called disk flowers, are orange-yellow. </p>

<p class="text-center">The Native American tribe Okanagan-Colville used Heartleaf Arnica as a love medicine. The roots were mixed with a Robin’s heart, tongue, and Ocher plant. The mixture was made into a powder and the user went into the water facing east, recited certain words, mentioned the name of the person he or she desired, and marked his or her face with the powdered arnica mixture.</p>

<p class="text-center">This whole plant is toxic to ingest, but you may be familiar with its use as a topical medicine. While a plant may be toxic, it can also be medicinal at the proper dosage. Arnica has anti-inflammatory properties and used externally, it can be applied to swellings, sprains, bruises, and wounds without broken skin. Other species within this genus have been used medicinally for thousands of years in the European Alps and by Native Americans. </p>
