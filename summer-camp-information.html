				<p>At the time of registration, you will be asked to review the following with your camper:</p>

				<p>Red Butte Garden takes the physical and emotional well-being of its campers very seriously, and strives to create a positive, warm, and supportive atmosphere during summer camp. Our camps are strict <strong><em>No Bullying Zones</em></strong> and place a strong emphasis on developing healthy relationships with people, plants, and the natural world.</p>

				<p class="bold green">In order to create an environment conducive to learning, campers agree to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Follow directions, obey camp rules, and stay with their group.</li>
					<li>Treat fellow campers, instructors, volunteers, and the Garden with respect.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In the event that a camper’s behavior endangers other campers, interferes with an instructor’s ability to provide quality programming, or fails to adhere to the Camper Code of Conduct, the instructor will inform the caregiver at pick-up or through a phone call/email. If more than two incidents occur, the camper will be asked to withdraw from camp. <strong><em>Refunds will not be given for behavior-related withdrawals.</em></strong></p>

				<p class="bold italic">At the staff's discretion, any consequence may be bypassed due to the severity and nature of a camper's behavior.</p>
