				<p>Caregivers are not allowed to remain with their camper during camp. If you feel your child is unable to be in camp without you, it may be best to wait a year before you send your camper to summer camp.</p>

				<p>A weekly Camp Overview can be found online for most camps. Each overview lists the day’s theme for each camp and includes suggestions to help you and your camper share the camp experience and continue learning at home. The order of events may change due to weather or other circumstances beyond our control.</p>

				<p>The week before your camp session starts, you will receive an email reminder that includes important information about camp such as check-in/checkout details, instructor biographies, and more.</p>

				<p>Red Butte Garden takes the physical and emotional well-being of its campers very seriously, and strives to create a positive, warm, and supportive atmosphere during summer camp. Our camps are strict <strong><em>No Bullying Zones</em></strong> and place a strong emphasis on developing healthy relationships with people, plants, and the natural world.</p>

				<p class="bold green">In order to create an environment conducive to learning, campers agree to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Follow directions, obey camp rules, and stay with their group.</li>
					<li>Treat fellow campers, instructors, volunteers, and the Garden with respect.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In the event that a camper’s behavior endangers other campers, interferes with an instructor’s ability to provide quality programming, or fails to adhere to the Camper Code of Conduct, the instructor will inform the caregiver at pick-up or through a phone call/email. If more than two incidents occur, the camper will be asked to withdraw from camp. <strong><em>Refunds will not be given for behavior-related withdrawals.</em></strong></p>

				<p class="bold italic">At the staff's discretion, any consequence may be bypassed due to the severity and nature of a camper's behavior.</p>

				<p>We know that the uncertainty of the waitlist is inconvenient, so we work hard to be very transparent with the process. Movement on the waitlist generally starts 2-3 weeks before the start of camp as our campers’ summer plans change, with the most movement happening the week before camp starts. If a space opens up and you're next on the list, we’ll send an email letting you know. You’ll then have until the end of the business day to sign up for that camp. If you don't sign up, we’ll email the next camper on the list to offer them the spot.</p>
