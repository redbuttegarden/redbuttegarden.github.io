<p class="text-center">This Utah native perennial has narrow leaves supported by a long single stem, topped with white flowers with yellow centers. In the common name, ‘Pearly’ comes from the rounded outer flower bracts that are pearl-colored and ‘Everlasting’ comes from the fact that the white papery bracts are long-lasting, sometimes into winter.    </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">If you look close, the flowers of this plant look like googly eyes. Coincidentally, the Native American tribe, Potawatomi placed the dried tops of the plants on a pan of live coals to hurt the eyes of the evil spirits and keep them away. Other Native American tribes used this plant to purify gifts offered to the sun or spirits as well as for protection from danger before battle.  </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">This plant is also used as medicine to Native Americans with a range of uses, from treating cold and cough symptoms, to use as a sedative. So don’t stare too long or it might put you to sleep, muah hahaha. </p>
