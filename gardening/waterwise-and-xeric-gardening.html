	<p>Red Butte Garden offers many classes on waterwise and native landscaping. The classes range from two-hour lectures to extensive three-week classes. Classes provide valuable information about design, plant selection, maintenance, as well as garden walks so you can see first hand what these plants look like in a garden setting. We also offer residential garden tours focusing on waterwise and native landscapes.</p>
