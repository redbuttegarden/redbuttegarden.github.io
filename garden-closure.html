<h4 class="green">To the Friends of Red Butte Garden, </h4>
<p>Many businesses across the state opened their doors this past May 1, 2020 weekend as a result of the governor moving the risk dial from red to orange. We are anxious to reopen Red Butte Garden and will do so once we can safely and responsibly address the social distancing and health protocols that are still advised. We continue to work with the University of Utah to create a phased reopen plan that is both a safe and positive experience for our staff, members, and guests.</p>
<p>While we are all looking forward to a return to normalcy, we recognize that this process will take some time, and we look forward to welcoming you all back to the Garden in the coming weeks. Please check our website regularly and follow us on social media for updates. </p>

	<h4 class="green">Red Butte Garden 2020 Summer Youth Programs Cancellation and Refunds </h4>

	<p>We know parents and caregivers devote many hours researching and scheduling summer break activities for their children, and we are grateful for those families who trust Red Butte Garden to provide safe, educational, and fun summer camp programming. We look forward to seeing our campers return each year—there is nothing more uplifting than the sound of children in the Garden.</p>
	<p>At Red Butte Garden, we are doing our part to protect those who make the Garden the extraordinary place it is, including our guests, members, volunteers, staff, and supporters like you. We are actively following the guidance of federal, state, county, and university officials to ensure our decisions reflect our dedication to helping slow the spread of COVID-19. It is because of this that we regretfully cancel all in-person youth programs and classes at the Garden through August 31, 2020. </p>
	<p>This cancellation includes: Garden Adventures, Lil’ Buds Classes, and Summer Camps
  <p>We recognize this is disheartening news and would like to express our shared disappointment in the current situation. Not only do we love spending the summer with you and your children, but canceling our programs also profoundly impacts our ability to fund future programs, Garden maintenance, and staff time.</p>
	<p>The Garden’s customer service team will work with you to apply your registration fees in the manner of your choosing. </p>
	<p>Your options include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A credit towards a membership purchase or renewal (including gift memberships)</li>
		  <li>The donation of all or a portion of your expenditure as a charitable gift</li>
		  <li>A full refund</li>
    </ul>

<p>Please be advised, the Garden will handle a significant number of inquiries during this time. Calls to the Garden may experience considerable delays. </p>

<p>To expedite this process, please complete our COVID-19 Class Refund Form at <a href="https://redbuttegarden.formstack.com/forms/covid19_class_refund"> https://redbuttegarden.formstack.com/forms/covid19_class_refund</a>". </p>
<p>You will receive an email from our customer service team once we have processed your request. If we do not hear from you, we will contact you directly.</p>

		<h4 class="green">Red Butte Garden 2020 Outdoor Concert Series </h4>

		<p>In these uncertain times, it is very difficult for us to know exactly if and when we might be able to host concerts this summer in the Red Butte Garden Amphitheatre. </p>
		<p>What we can say with a high degree of certainty is that there will be no concerts in May or June of this year. As the situation evolves and we learn more, we will update this website to make sure you have the most current information.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your support of the Outdoor Concert Series. We look forward to enjoying a show with all of you sometime soon. Take care and stay healthy. </p>

<br />
		<h4 class="green">Red Butte Garden 2020 Spring Plant Sale Fundraiser Cancellation </h4>

		<p>We know many of you look forward to the annual Red Butte Garden spring plant sale, and we are grateful that you trust us to help keep your garden stocked with quality annuals, perennials, veggies and herbs, as well as Utah natives. </p>
		<p>Unfortunately this year we are unable to host our event because of the constraints of social distancing and precautions being taken to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. </p>
		<p>We’re all disappointed that so many of the spring activities and events we look forward to are being cancelled, and we look forward to the time when we can welcome you back to the Garden and share tips and tricks for keeping your own garden growing. Stay healthy and take comfort in the beauty all around you.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="green">March 13 Garden Closure</h4>
<p>The health and well-being of the Red Butte Garden community—our staff, students, volunteers, guests, and members—is our highest priority. That is why, in consideration of the protective measures recommended by our governor and the University of Utah to combat the coronavirus, <b>we closed the Garden to the public at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, March 13 and will remain closed until further notice.</b>
   We will continue to apply the cleaning and social distancing protocols being advocated by the University of Utah. </p>

<p>Look for up-to-date communications on the <a href="https://dps.utah.edu/coronavirus/">University of Utah Dept. of Public Safety webpage.</a> </p>
<p>Red Butte Garden staff will continue operations to ensure the upkeep of the Garden and facilities so that we can be ready to receive guests as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We will provide more information as the situation progresses. See updates below. Stay tuned and stay healthy.</p>
