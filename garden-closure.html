<h4 class="green">To the Friends of Red Butte Garden, </h4>

<p>The health and well-being of the Red Butte Garden community—our staff, students, volunteers, guests, and members—is our highest priority. That is why, in consideration of the protective measures recommended by our governor and the University of Utah to combat the coronavirus, <b>we closed the Garden to the public at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, March 13 and will remain closed until further notice.</b>
   We will continue to apply the cleaning and social distancing protocols being advocated by the University of Utah. </p>

<p>Look for up-to-date communications on the <a href="https://dps.utah.edu/coronavirus/">University of Utah Dept. of Public Safety webpage.</a> </p>
<p>Red Butte Garden staff will continue operations to ensure the upkeep of the Garden and facilities so that we can be ready to receive guests as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We will provide more information as the situation progresses. See updates below. Stay tuned and stay healthy.</p>

	<h4 class="green">Potential disruption to Red Butte Garden 2020 Summer Camp schedule </h4>

	<p>We know parents and caregivers devote many hours researching and scheduling summer break activities for their children, and we are grateful for those families who trust Red Butte Garden to provide safe, educational, and fun summer camp programming. We look forward to seeing our campers return each year—there is nothing more uplifting than the sound of children in the Garden.</p>
	<p>During this uncertain time, it is important for us to acknowledge that we may soon be in a position where we are unable to fulfill our summer camp and Lil' Buds class schedules. If and when we need to exercise this option, we will issue full refunds to those who have paid for summer camps. Families may also decide to cancel now and receive a full refund.</p>
	<p>We will regularly update our website and provide new details to our summer camp patrons as they become available.</p>

		<h4 class="green">Red Butte Garden 2020 Outdoor Concert Series </h4>

		<p>In these uncertain times, it is very difficult for us to know exactly if and when we might be able to host concerts this summer in the Red Butte Garden Amphitheatre. </p>
		<p>What we can say with a high degree of certainty is that there will be no concerts in May or June of this year. As the situation evolves and we learn more, we will update this website to make sure you have the most current information.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your support of the Outdoor Concert Series. We look forward to enjoying a show with all of you sometime soon. Take care and stay healthy. </p>

<br />
		<h4 class="green">Red Butte Garden 2020 Spring Plant Sale Fundraiser </h4>

		<p>We know many of you look forward to the annual Red Butte Garden spring plant sale, and we are grateful that you trust us to help keep your garden stocked with quality annuals, perennials, veggies and herbs, as well as Utah natives. </p>
		<p>Unfortunately this year we are unable to host our event because of the constraints of social distancing and precautions being taken to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. </p>
		<p>We’re all disappointed that so many of the spring activities and events we look forward to are being cancelled, and we look forward to the time when we can welcome you back to the Garden and share tips and tricks for keeping your own garden growing. Stay healthy and take comfort in the beauty all around you.</p>
