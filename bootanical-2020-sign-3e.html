<p class="text-center">Sassafras is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 60 feet tall. In the wild it spreads by root suckers to form large colonies. It is dioecious which means male and female flowers appear on separate plants. The tree produces attractive greenish-yellow flower clusters in spring. If the female flowers are pollinated, they form bluish-black drupes (a type of fruit like plums and cherries) that mature in September. All parts of the plant are spicy and aromatic.</p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">The roots, bark, leaves, new shoots, and pith from the branches were used extensively for a wide variety of mainly medicinal purposes by Native Americans. Infusions were made from the outer and inner portions of the roots. The infusions were taken internally to treat many ailments such as fever, diarrhea, rheumatism, measles, scarlet fever, coughs, as well as to purify the blood, as a dietary aid, a mouthwash, and gargled for colds. </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">Sassafras was traditionally used as the main flavoring ingredient in Root Beer. Sassafras contains safrole, which the FDA banned in 1960 due to its carcinogenic effects. Safrole was found to contribute to liver cancer in rats when given in high doses, and thus Sassafras was banned, along with Sarsparilla, another safrole containing plant. Soon after the ban, companies developed artificial flavors to replace the forbidden ingredient. </p>
