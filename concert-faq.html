	    <div class="panel-body">

				<p>Be aware that third-party ticket resellers and brokers use the 'Red Butte Garden' name in some way to sell overpriced or invalid tickets online. The recommended course of action is to not use third-party reseller sites and ONLY purchase authetic tickets directly from Red Butte Garden, <!--Ticketfly,--> or an artist’s official fan club. This is the only way to be sure you get authentic, face-value priced tickets.

				<p>Purchasers of Red Butte Garden concert and event tickets may not resell their tickets for more than the face value of the ticket. Purchasers who are caught reselling their tickets for above face-value may be subject to ejection from the Red Butte Garden event, may have their tickets revoked, and may be banned from the future purchase of tickets to Red Butte Garden events. <a href="/concert-terms-conditions">CLICK HERE</a> to see all of the Terms &amp; Conditions that apply to your concert ticket ("license"). </p>

        <p><strong>Q: Why are Red Butte Garden concert tickets available for purchase on third-party vendor/reseller sites (such as StubHub or KSL)? </strong>
				<p>A: We do not partner with any third-party ticket resellers and do not recommend purchasing tickets through resellers. Unfortunately, ticket reselling is legal in the state of Utah, so we cannot completely prevent reselling, however, we do monitor ticket limits and will cancel orders with ticket numbers above the allotted limits. No reseller has tickets to any of our concerts before the Garden member presale date. Some ticket brokers have signed up for Garden memberships but they must purchase their tickets just like other Garden members with the same limitations on the number of tickets that can be purchased. </p>

				<p>If you purchase tickets from a reseller, please be aware that they may not actually have tickets in hand when they take your money, the tickets will be overpriced and may be invalid. We cannot verify that a ticket is valid until the ticket is scanned at the entrance gate on the night of the concert. It may be a ticket number that was sold twice, meaning that it will scan as USED and you may be denied entry into the venue, or you may have purchased a ticket that was cancelled due to a ticket limit violation. Red Butte Garden cannot look up or reprint tickets purchased through a reseller.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Why do some online ticket resellers offer concert tickets for sale before they go on sale to Garden members? </strong>
				<p><strong class="red">A: These ticket resellers DO NOT have tickets in hand!</strong> They claim to have tickets, and hope to acquire them through normal or other channels before the concert date. It’s a gamble. A good clue is if the ticket offered is overpriced and has language that says: “ticket will be delivered by XX date,”- this usually means they do not have a ticket in hand, and that they will try to acquire one once they have a potential buyer (ie: your money).

	    <div class="panel-body">

        <p><strong>Q: Why are concert tickets available to concert artist fan clubs? </strong>
				<p>Many artist contracts specify that we are to hold a small number of general admission tickets for the artist to sell directly to their fan club. These tickets are available only on the artist’s official web site to fan club members, and only for a short period of time. In addition to any fan club membership fees, tickets are offered at the full public price. Red Butte Garden does not control when artists put their fan club tickets on sale.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I purchase fan club tickets? </strong>
				<p>A: Anyone can purchase artist fan club tickets by joining an artist's fan club, but there is not a Garden member discount applied to fan club tickets.</p>
