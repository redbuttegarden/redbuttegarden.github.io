<p>Did you know April is National Poetry Month? Celebrate this important literary art with a stroll through the Garden to find eleven poetry boxes featuring poems written by winners of our Spring Poetry Contest.</p>

<p>Throughout April the Garden also hosts a special audio tour featuring recordings of our contest winners performing readings of their poems, all accessible from your cell phone.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions at each poetry box to access audio recordings. The audio tour is free, but normal cell phone carrier usage rates apply. Please be considerate of other Garden guests and listen to audio content through headphones or your phone’s earpiece.</p>

<p>Sign up to attend a Garden Poetry Reading featuring live readings from many of the poets themselves on Wednesday, April 26 from 5:30-6:30PM. <a href="/poetry-reading">CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP</a></p>
