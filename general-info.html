The permit is valid for a year from the date of purchase. All other rules and regulations apply.</p>

<p><b>Wedding Photography/Portraits:</b> All wedding portraits must call ahead to schedule their session. We hold many wedding ceremonies and receptions at the Garden and will refuse requests for wedding photography during another's wedding.
