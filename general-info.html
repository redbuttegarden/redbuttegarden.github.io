		<!--<p class="red">To help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, Red Butte Garden is currently closed to the public and all on-site events are cancelled until further notice.</p>-->

		<!--<p>Many businesses across the state opened their doors this past May 1 weekend as a result of the governor moving the risk dial from red to orange. We are anxious to reopen Red Butte Garden and will do so once we can safely and responsibly address the social distancing and health protocols that are still advised. We continue to work with the University of Utah to create a phased reopen plan that is both a safe and positive experience for our staff, members, and guests.</p>
		<p>While we are all looking forward to a return to normalcy, we recognize that this process will take some time, and we look forward to welcoming you all back to the Garden in the coming weeks. Please check our website regularly and follow us on social media for updates.</p>-->

		<p>There is no direct public transportation to Red Butte Garden though there are options that will get you close to the Visitor Center and Amphitheatre. From these stops, you can either walk to the Garden or catch one of the University’s free shuttles. It is an uphill hike to the Garden and Amphitheatre from bus and TRAX stops, and there aren’t many sidewalks in Research Park, so you must walk on the road in some areas.</p>
		<p>Check the public transportation schedules for routes to the University of Utah campus, medical center, or Research Park before planning your trip to the Garden:</p>
