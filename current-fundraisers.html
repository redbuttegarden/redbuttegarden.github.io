		<p>Each year, over 18,000 school children participate in our acclaimed educational outreach programs and school field trips. During the summer, children attend camps where they learn about bugs, cooking, prehistoric plants and many other exciting topics! First-graders across the state participate in our Grow Lab Program where they learn to plant and care for seeds in their own classrooms. We are also pleased to announce the success and continued development of the Botany Bin Program.
		In addition, the Garden offers over 50 classes each year for adults and families.</p>
