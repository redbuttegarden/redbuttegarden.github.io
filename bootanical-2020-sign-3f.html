<p class="text-center">Wormwood is a woody-based aromatic perennial with attractive silver-gray foliage. The flowers are pale yellow, tubular, and clustered in spherical nodding heads. </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">This cultivar of the famous Wormwood is used to make the green-colored alcoholic drink absinthe, which is a spirit with a high percentage of alcohol. While many believe absinthe is supposed to make you hallucinate, this is not the case. Studies were conducted in the 19th century by a psychiatrist studying alcoholics and wrongly concluded that chronic absinthe drinkers had more serious health complications, such as hallucinations and seizures, than other chronic drinkers. This conclusion, along with the rise of alcohol-blamed violence in the late 1800s and early 1900s caused absinthe to be banned in many places around the world. More recent studies have concluded that the recorded hallucinogenic effects from absinthe were due to overconsumption, alcohol withdrawal, or impure alcohol or toxic colorings.  </p>

<p class="text-center">Wormwood has been used in medicine since ancient times. Wormwood contains thujone, which can stimulate the nervous system. It is also used to treat digestive problems and intestinal worms. Interestingly, it is also used as an insecticide. </p>
