<h5 class="text-center">Aralia Family</center></h5></p>
<br />

<p class="text-center">This is a rhizomatous, shrubby looking, herbaceous perennial, in the same family as Ginseng. The soft stems are dark maroon to almost black and they rise from large aromatic roots. The stems bear large, pinnate compound leaves with toothed margins. Tiny greenish-white flowers bloom in long panicles. Flowers are followed by dense hanging clusters of drupes (type of fruit) that mature to dark purple. </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">The root of American Spikenard is used by Native Americans and herbalists as a medicine for lung infections such as coughs, catarrh, and tuberculosis. A poultice of the roots is used externally to treat infections, burns, skin irritations, ulcers, and swellings. The roots are also used to flavor teas and as an ingredient in root beer. </p>
