<p class="text-center">Meadow Saffron is an herbaceous perennial stemming from a corm. In the spring, the plant sends up only foliage, then go dormant during the heat of the summer. In early fall, it produces flowers with purple translucent petals atop a white stem.   </p>
<br/>

<p class="text-center">Members of Colchicum genus contain colchicine, which is lethal in high doses. In the late 19th century, British serial killer Catherine Wilson, the last woman who was publicly hanged, was convicted of murdering her landlady with this deadly toxin. However, she is believed to have killed at least seven others using this same toxin. The murder usually happened after the victims had written her into their will. The poison induces vomiting, abdominal cramps, severe diarrhea, followed by respiratory, renal, and cardiac failure.  </p>

<p class="text-center">In low doses, colchicine is used as a treatment for gout. Legend says that Benjamin Franklin used colchicine medicine to treat his gout, and brought the medicine to America. Colchicine is still used today to treat gout, notably in the prescription medicine Colcrys. </p>
